# Xylda's AutoKMS - Best way to activate your Windows Operating System
<img src="images/banner.png">

# About 
AutoKMS is a tool commonly used for activating Microsoft Windows operating systems and Microsoft Office software without purchasing a valid license from Microsoft. The term "KMS" stands for Key Management Service, which is a legitimate technology developed by Microsoft for large organizations to activate Windows and Office installations in bulk. AutoKMS mimics this legitimate service to bypass the official activation process.

## How AutoKMS Works
Emulating a KMS Server: AutoKMS creates a local server that pretends to be a legitimate KMS server. Windows and Office products are designed to connect to a KMS server to verify the activation status. AutoKMS takes advantage of this by making the system believe it is communicating with a valid server.

Activation Process: Once installed, AutoKMS initiates the activation process by connecting to this emulated server. It provides the necessary responses to activate the software as if it were a legitimate KMS server.

Reactivation: KMS activations are temporary, typically valid for 180 days. AutoKMS sets up a task in the Task Scheduler to re-run the activation at regular intervals, ensuring that the activation status remains valid without user intervention.
