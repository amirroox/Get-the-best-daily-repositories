These mounds vary geographically in mean orientation in a manner that suggests such variation is an adaptive response to local environmental conditions. Theoretical modelling of solar irradiance and mound rotation experiments show that maintenance of an eastern face temperature plateau during the dry season is the most likely physical basis for the mound orientation response. Subsequent heat transfer analysis shows that habitat wind speed and shading conditions also affect face temperature gradients such as the rate of eastern face temperature change. It is then demonstrated that the geographic variation in mean mound orientation follows the geographic variation in long-term wind speed and shading conditions across northern Australia such that an eastern face temperature plateau is maintained in all locations.,TRUE\n2. Infrared and visible reflectance in different lichen species and its ecological significance,,TRUE\nA bio-inspired visual collision detection mechanism for cars: Optimisation of a model of a locust neuron to a novel environment,\"The lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) neuron of locusts has been shown to preferentially respond to objects approaching the eye of a locust on a direct collision course. Computer simulations of the neuron have been developed and have demonstrated the ability of mobile robots, interfaced with a simulated LGMD model, to avoid collisions. In this study, a model of the LGMD neuron is presented and the functional parameters of the model identified. Models with different parameters were presented with a range of automotive video sequences, including collisions with cars. The parameters were optimised to respond correctly to the video sequences using a range of genetic algorithms (GAs). The model evolved most rapidly using GAs with high clone rates into a form suitable for detecting collisions with cars and not producing false collision alerts to most non-collision scenes.\",TRUE\nA Biological Screw in a Beetle\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Leg,Joints on the legs of weevils form a functional screw-and-nut system. The coxa-trochanteral joints on the legs of the weevil Trigonopterus oblongus (Pascoe) work as a biological screw-and-nut system. The apical portions of the coxae closely resemble nuts with well-defined inner threads covering 345\u00ac\u221e. The corresponding trochanters have perfectly compatible external spiral threads of 410\u00ac\u221e.,TRUE\nA Biological Solution to a Fundamental Distributed Computing Problem,\"Modeling of development in the fruit fly yields an algorithm useful in designing wireless communication networks. Computational and biological systems are often distributed so that processors (cells) jointly solve a task, without any of them receiving all inputs or observing all outputs. Maximal independent set (MIS) selection is a fundamental distributed computing procedure that seeks to elect a set of local leaders in a network. A variant of this problem is solved during the development of the fly\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nervous system, when sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells are chosen. By studying SOP selection, we derived a fast algorithm for MIS selection that combines two attractive features. First, processors do not need to know their degree; second, it has an optimal message complexity while only using one-bit messages. Our findings suggest that simple and efficient algorithms can be developed on the basis of biologically derived insights.\",TRUE\nA biological sub-micron thickness optical broadband reflector characterized using both light and microwaves,\"Broadband optical reflectors generally function through coherent scattering from systems comprising one of three designs: overlapped; chirped; or chaotic multilayer reflectors. For each, the requirement to scatter a broad band of wavelengths is met through the presence of a variation in nanostructural periodicity running perpendicular to the systems' outer surfaces. Consequently, the requisite total thickness of the multilayer can often be in excess of 50\u201a\u00c4\u00e4\u0152\u00bam. Here, we report the discovery and the microwave-assisted characterization of a natural system that achieves excellent optical broadband reflectivity but that is less than 1\u201a\u00c4\u00e4\u0152\u00bam thick. This system, found on the wing scales of the butterfly Argyrophorus argenteus, comprises a distinctive variation in periodicity that runs parallel to the reflecting surface, rather than perpendicular to it. In this way, the requirement for an extensively thick system is removed.\",TRUE\nA branched material based on biomimetic design: Synthesis and electrochemical properties,\"Based on the biomimetic route the metal material with tree-like fractal structure was prepared, which showed a rough surface observed by scanning electron microscopy. According to the electrochemical experiments, the formed material exhibited the strong catalytic capability as an electrode in hydrogen evolution reaction, comparing with other conventional structure materials under comparable scales. We suggested this promotion of property arose from the contribution of the great surface area and the excellent connectivity offered from the fractal structure.
