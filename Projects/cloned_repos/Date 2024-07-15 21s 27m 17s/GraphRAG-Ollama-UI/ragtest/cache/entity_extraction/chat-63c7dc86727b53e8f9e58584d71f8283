Second, the general structure (noting sensory cell numbers, gross anatomy, and location of peripheral attachment sites) of both meso- and metathoracic organs is surveyed in 23 species representing seven superfamilies of the Lepidoptera. The structure of the wing-hinge chordotonal organ in both thoracic segments was found to be remarkably conserved in all superfamilies of the Macrolepidoptera examined except the Noctuoidea, where fewer than three cells occur in the metathoracic ear (one cell in representatives of the Notodontidae and two cells in those of other families examined), and at the mesothoracic wing-hinge (two cells) in the Notodontidae only. By mapping cell numbers onto current phylogenies of the Macrolepidoptera, we demonstrate that the three-celled wing-hinge chordotonal organ, believed to be a wing proprioceptor, represents the plesiomorphic state from which the tympanal organ in the Noctuoidea evolved. This \u201a\u00c4\u00f4trend toward simplicity\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 in the noctuoid ear contrasts an apparent \u201a\u00c4\u00f4trend toward complexity\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 in several other insect hearing organs where atympanate homologues have been studied. The advantages to having fewer rather than more cells in the moth ear, which functions primarily to detect the echolocation calls of bats, is discussed.\",TRUE\nEvolution-guided discovery of antibiotics that inhibit peptidoglycan remodelling,\"Addressing the ongoing antibiotic crisis requires the discovery of compounds with novel mechanisms of action that are capable of treating drug-resistant infections 1 . Many antibiotics are sourced from specialized metabolites produced by bacteria, particularly those of the Actinomycetes family 2 . Although actinomycete extracts have traditionally been screened using activity-based platforms, this approach has become unfavourable owing to the frequent rediscovery of known compounds. Genome sequencing of actinomycetes reveals an untapped reservoir of biosynthetic gene clusters, but prioritization is required to predict which gene clusters may yield promising new chemical matter 2 . Here we make use of the phylogeny of biosynthetic genes along with the lack of known resistance determinants to predict divergent members of the glycopeptide family of antibiotics that are likely to possess new biological activities. Using these predictions, we uncovered two members of a new functional class of glycopeptide antibiotics\u201a\u00c4\u00eethe known glycopeptide antibiotic complestatin and a newly discovered compound we call corbomycin\u201a\u00c4\u00eethat have a novel mode of action. We show that by binding to peptidoglycan, complestatin and corbomycin block the action of autolysins\u201a\u00c4\u00eeessential peptidoglycan hydrolases that are required for remodelling of the cell wall during growth. Corbomycin and complestatin have low levels of resistance development and are effective in reducing bacterial burden in a mouse model of skin MRSA infection. The glycopeptide antibiotic-related compounds complestatin and corbomycin function by binding to peptidoglycan and blocking the action of autolysins\u201a\u00c4\u00eepeptidoglycan hydrolase enzymes that remodel the cell wall during growth.\",TRUE\nEvolutionary diverse Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Old Yellow Enzymes reveal distinctive catalytic properties and potential for whole-cell biotransformations,\"Abstract Old Yellow Enzymes (OYEs) selectively reduce carbon\u201a\u00c4\u00ebcarbon double bonds of a broad range of substrates with excellent stereoselectivity. Current challenges of their application in bio-based industrial processes are the cost-efficient regeneration of the nicotinamide co-substrate and expanding the range of industrially relevant substrates. Microalgae represent a rich and mostly untapped source for OYEs with novel catalytic properties and are promising whole-cell factories that regenerate nicotinamide by photosynthesis. By comparative phylogenetics, we identified 20 putative OYEs in eleven algal species. Three recombinant OYEs from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrOYEs) reveal diverse biocatalytic properties and potential for enzyme optimization. High substrate conversion activities of living algal wild type and mutant cells linked the biocatalytic profiles to in vivo functionality and demonstrate the potential of microalgae as sources for distinctive OYE activities and for light-driven biotransformations.\",TRUE\nExact Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Confined Lattice Random Walks in Arbitrary Dimensions: A Century after Smoluchowski and P\u221a\u2265lya,An exact solution to the discrete diffusion equation allows for accurate predictions of how the probabilities of reaction diffusion processes evolve over time\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
