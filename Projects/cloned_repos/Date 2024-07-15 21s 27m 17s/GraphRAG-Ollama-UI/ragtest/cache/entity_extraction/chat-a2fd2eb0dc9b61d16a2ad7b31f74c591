How, then, is the energy in a jump (4100\u201a\u00c4\u00ec4800 \u0152\u00baJ) or kick (1700 \u0152\u00baJ) dissipated? A specialised buckling region found in the proximal hind-tibia where the bending moment is high, but not present in the other legs, buckled and allowed the distal part of the tibia to extend. In jumps when a hindleg slipped, it bent by a mean of 23\u00ac\u00b114 deg at a velocity of 13.4\u00ac\u00b19.5 deg ms\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1; in kicks that failed to contact a target it bent by 32\u00ac\u00b116 deg at a velocity of 32.9\u00ac\u00b19.5 deg ms\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1. It also buckled 8.5\u00ac\u00b14.0 deg at a rate of 0.063\u00ac\u00b10.005 deg ms\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1 when the tibia was prevented from flexing fully about the femur in preparation for both these movements. By experimentally buckling this region through 40 deg at velocities of 0.001\u201a\u00c4\u00ec0.65 deg ms\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1, we showed that one hindleg could store about 870 \u0152\u00baJ on bending, of which 210 \u0152\u00baJ was dissipated back to the leg on release. A band of blue fluorescence was revealed at the buckling region under UV illumination that had the two key signatures of the elastic protein resilin. A group of campaniform sensilla 300 \u0152\u00bam proximal to the buckling region responded to imposed buckling movements. The features of the buckling region show that it can act as a shock absorber as proposed previously when jumping and kicking movements go wrong.\",TRUE\nA Clerodane Diterpene from Callicarpa americana Resensitizes Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus to \u221a\u00fc-Lactam Antibiotics.,\"The rise of antibiotic resistance presents a significant healthcare challenge and precludes the use of many otherwise valuable antibiotics. One potential solution to this problem is the use of antibiotics in combination with resistance-modifying agents, compounds that act synergistically with existing antibiotics to resensitize previously resistant bacteria. In this study, 12(S),16\u0152\u00e6-dihydroxycleroda-3,13-dien-15,16-olide, a clerodane diterpene isolated from the medicinal plant Callicarpa americana, was found to synergize with oxacillin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This synergy was confirmed by checkerboard (FICI = 0.125) and time-kill assays, with a sub-inhibitory dose of 12(S),16\u0152\u00e6-dihydroxycleroda-3,13-dien-15,16-olide causing the effective concentration of oxacillin to fall below the susceptibility breakpoint for S. aureus, a > 32-fold decrease in both cases.\",TRUE\nA conserved spider silk domain acts as a molecular switch that controls fibre assembly,\"A huge variety of proteins are able to form fibrillar structures, especially at high protein concentrations. Hence, it is surprising that spider silk proteins can be stored in a soluble form at high concentrations and transformed into extremely stable fibres on demand. Silk proteins are reminiscent of amphiphilic block copolymers containing stretches of polyalanine and glycine-rich polar elements forming a repetitive core flanked by highly conserved non-repetitive amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain comprises a secretion signal, but further functions remain unassigned. The C-terminal domain was implicated in the control of solubility and fibre formation initiated by changes in ionic composition and mechanical stimuli known to align the repetitive sequence elements and promote \u0152\u2264-sheet formation. However, despite recent structural data, little is known about this remarkable behaviour in molecular detail. Here we present the solution structure of the C-terminal domain of a spider dragline silk protein and provide evidence that the structural state of this domain is essential for controlled switching between the storage and assembly forms of silk proteins. In addition, the C-terminal domain also has a role in the alignment of secondary structural features formed by the repetitive elements in the backbone of spider silk proteins, which is known to be important for the mechanical properties of the fibre.\",TRUE\nA Cultured Greigite-Producing Magnetotactic Bacterium in a Novel\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
