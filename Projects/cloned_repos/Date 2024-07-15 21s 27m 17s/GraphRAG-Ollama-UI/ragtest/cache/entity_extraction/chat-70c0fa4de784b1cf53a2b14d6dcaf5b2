{"result": " Title: Passive Ventilation System Inspired by Broken Stems and Aerenchyma in Wetland Plants\n\nDescription: This biological strategy involves the use of broken stems and aerenchyma (gas-filled tissue) in wetland plants to create a passive ventilation system. This system helps remove stale air and introduce fresh oxygen into the plant, promoting healing and growth. The principle behind this strategy is the Bernoulli effect, where faster-moving air has lower pressure. This can be applied to disaster recovery efforts by creating networks of gas flow to deliver oxygen to specific areas. Additionally, understanding how wetland plants transport gases could lead to technologies that remove water pollution.\n\nKeywords: Passive ventilation, Bernoulli effect, aerenchyma, wetland plants, disaster recovery, gas exchange, ethylene, carbon dioxide, oxygen, mycorrhizal fungi, Wood Wide Web.\n\nReferences:\n- Colmer, T.

Most The aerenchyma spaces rely on pressure gradients of the oxygen enters the roots through diffusion, when to drive the gasses from areas of high pressure to molecules are driven to move from areas with higher areas of low pressure. In some cases, air is drawn into concentrations to areas with lower ones. In very wet living sections of the plant through the stomata (gas-soil, this becomes much more difficult because oxygen exchange holes) of the leaf sheaths, sending oxygen diffusion in water is 10,000 times slower than in air.
