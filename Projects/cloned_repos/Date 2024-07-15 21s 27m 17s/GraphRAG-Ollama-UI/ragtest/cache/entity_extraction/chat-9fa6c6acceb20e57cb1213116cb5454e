{"result": " The text describes a biological strategy used by Egyptian fruit bats and potentially other animals for finding and navigating towards their desired objects, such as food. This strategy involves emitting high-pitched sounds (echolocation) at an angle to the side of the object of interest rather than directly at it. The returning sound waves are then analyzed to determine the relative position and movement of the object.\n\nThis \"raking sound\" approach allows the bat to gather more information about the object's location with each click, improving its accuracy in finding and landing on the object. This strategy could be useful for optimizing search functions for drones or other robots that use light, sound, or scent to track objects.\n\nThe text also mentions another biological strategy used by Bornean tree-hole frogs, which involves adjusting the pitch of their call to match the resonance frequency of a tree hole to amplify the sound of their call. This could potentially be applied to improve sound amplification in various technological applications.\n\nOverall, the text highlights the importance of studying and understanding the strategies used by animals in nature as potential sources of inspiration for technological innovation.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

Suddenly, initial calls don\u2019t provide much information about how something the size of a small dog swoops by through the searcher and the searched are moving side to side the air. Is it a bird? A drone? No, it\u2019s an Egyptian fruit relative to each other. As a result, such an approach has bat, in search of overripe figs.\n\nlimited value in helping the animal fine-tune its position as it moves closer to its target.\n\nLike other bats, this outsized flying mammal finds its food by clicking its tongue to produce sound waves Enter the sound waves at the perimeter of the cone.\n\nand observing how they bounce back. At first it aims If the bat aims its clicks to the side of the object, the its clicks widely as it searches for a piece of fruit. Once sound waves that bounce back from the slanted part the returning sound waves reveal food item, however, of the cone of sound contain more information about the search strategy changes. Rather than pointing the the relative movement between the searcher and\n\nsound waves directly the object of its desire, the bat the searched than would those aimed directly at the aims them slightly left and then slightly right of the object. By listening for the bounce back of sound waves target. Although this strategy seems counterintuitive, at the edge of the cone where the difference in timing it improves the accuracy with which the bat can land on is larger, the bat can more easily tell if it\u2019s getting its favored food.\n\n\u201cwarmer\u201d or \u201ccolder\u201d from one click to the next and adjust its trajectory accordingly.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nSound waves travel in an expanding, cone-shaped path This is similar to the effect that we perceive when from their source. The best way for an animal using viewing an object in light that shines nearly parallel echolocation to find an object in the first place is to to a surface, as the sun does at dawn and dusk. In this point its clicks in lots of different directions.

This suggests it is broadly beneficial as a \u201choming-in strategy.\u201d Humans might apply a similar strategy to optimizing the search function for drones or other robots that use light, sound, Egyptian fruit bat in flight.
