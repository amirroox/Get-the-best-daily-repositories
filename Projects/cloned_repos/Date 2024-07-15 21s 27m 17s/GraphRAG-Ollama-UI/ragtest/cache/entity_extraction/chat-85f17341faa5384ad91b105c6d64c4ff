Cellulose fibers are formed from close-packed single chains of cellulose that have been proposed to be formed by multimeric complexes (18 or more subunits) of the enzyme cellulose synthase, which exists in several isoforms. Purushotham et al. determined a cryo\u201a\u00c4\u00ecelectron microscopy structure of a trimer of a single isoform of cellulose synthase. A large channel forms a path for cellulose chains through the membrane-embedded complex. The structure also reveals oligomeric interfaces and provides a framework for modeling the larger complexes seen in plant membranes. The close arrangement of exit sites for nascent glycan chains is consistent with the enzyme complex playing a role in directing cellulose microfibril formation. Science, this issue p. 1089 The structure of a homotrimeric cellulose synthase complex provides molecular insights into cellulose fibril formation. Cellulose is an essential plant cell wall component and represents the most abundant biopolymer on Earth. Supramolecular plant cellulose synthase complexes organize multiple linear glucose polymers into microfibrils as load-bearing wall components. We determined the structure of a poplar cellulose synthase CesA homotrimer that suggests a molecular basis for cellulose microfibril formation. This complex, stabilized by cytosolic plant-conserved regions and helical exchange within the transmembrane segments, forms three channels occupied by nascent cellulose polymers. Secretion steers the polymers toward a common exit point, which could facilitate protofibril formation. CesA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s N-terminal domains assemble into a cytosolic stalk that interacts with a microtubule-tethering protein and may thus be involved in CesA localization. Our data suggest how cellulose synthase complexes assemble and provide the molecular basis for plant cell wall engineering.\",TRUE\nArtificial Muscle Begins to Breathe,\"In robots, the power source is usually distant from the actual moving parts, which can be inefficient. One solution is to provide power locally, as in real muscles, by incorporating fuel cell technology directly into artificial muscles.\",TRUE\nAspilia spp. Leaves: A puzzle in the feeding behavior of wild chimpanzees,\"Unlike other chimpanzee food items, the leaves ofAspilia pluriseta, A. rudis and A. mossambicensis (Compositae) are eaten without being chewed. Moreover,A. pluriseta andA. rudis are eaten slowly and singly and particularly in the early morning. This unusual behavior suggests thatAspilia leaves offer peculiar stimuli, perhaps with pharmacological effects.\",TRUE\nAssembly mechanism of recombinant spider silk proteins,\"Spider silk threads are formed by the irreversible aggregation of silk proteins in a spinning duct with dimensions of only a few micrometers. Here, we present a microfluidic device in which engineered and recombinantly produced spider dragline silk proteins eADF3 (engineered Araneus diadematus fibroin) and eADF4 are assembled into fibers. Our approach allows the direct observation and identification of the essential parameters of dragline silk assembly. Changes in ionic conditions and pH result in aggregation of the two proteins. Assembly of eADF3 fibers was induced only in the presence of an elongational flow component. Strikingly, eADF4 formed fibers only in combination with eADF3. On the basis of these results, we propose a model for dragline silk aggregation and early steps of fiber assembly in the microscopic regime.\",TRUE\nAssessment of the Phytotoxic Potential of m-Tyrosine in Laboratory Soil Bioassays,\"The significance of soil-allelochemical interactions was addressed in this paper through studies conducted with m-tyrosine, an amino acid analogue and a potent plant growth inhibitor, in a series of laboratory assays performed in field soil or growth media. The studies were performed as a basis for further evaluation of m-tyrosine activity in field soils containing living plant roots. Here, we examined the role of common soil amendments, including ammonium nitrate fertilizer and activated carbon, in overcoming plant growth inhibition in soils in a laboratory setting by using lettuce as a sensitive indicator of plant toxicity. The phytotoxicity of m-tyrosine was not influenced significantly by soil N amendment; however, when significant amounts of activated carbon were added to the soil medium, growth inhibition in treated lettuce seedlings was strongly reduced. Soil texture did not influence the bioavailability or activity of m-tyrosine, as activity in high organic growth media was similar to that of sand and soil mixtures. Similar to other purported allelochemicals, soil persistence of m-tyrosine was limited, with a predicted half life of less\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
