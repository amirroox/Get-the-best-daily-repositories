The function of this glue depends on metals, raising the possibility that metal-catalyzed oxidation plays a role. The extent and time course of protein oxidation was measured by immunoblotting to detect the resulting carbonyl groups. Several proteins, particularly one with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 165\u221a\u00f3103, were heavily oxidized. Of the proteins known to distinguish the glue from non-adhesive mucus, only specific size variants were oxidized. The oxidation appears to occur within the first few seconds of secretion. Although carbonyls were detected by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in denatured proteins, they were not easily detected in the native state. The presence of reversible cross-links derived from carbonyls was tested for by treatment with sodium borohydride, which would reduce uncross-linked carbonyls to alcohols, but stabilize imine bonds formed by carbonyls and thus lead to less soluble complexes. Consistent with imine bond formation, sodium borohydride led to a 20\u201a\u00c4\u00ec35% decrease in the amount of soluble protein with a Mr of 40\u201a\u00c4\u00ec165 (\u221a\u00f3103) without changing the carbonyl content per protein. In contrast, the nucleophile hydroxylamine, which would competitively disrupt imine bonds, increased protein solubility in the glue. Finally, the primary amine groups on a protein with a Mr of 15\u221a\u00f3103 were not accessible to acid anhydrides. The results suggest that cross-links between aldehydes and primary amines contribute to the cohesive strength of the glue.\",TRUE\nCrossflow filtration in suspension-feeding fishes,\"Rows of comb-like or tufted gill rakers in the oral cavity of suspension-feeding fishes (for example, herring, anchovies and tilapia) have been thought to serve as (1) non-porous barriers that direct particle-laden water to the sticky oral roof, where particles are retained as water exits from the oral cavity, (2) conventional dead-end filters that sieve particles from water exiting between rakers, or (3) sticky filters that retain particles encountered by a hydrosol filtration mechanism. Here we present data from computational fluid dynamics and video endoscopy in suspension-feeding fish indicating that the rakers of three distantly related species function instead as a crossflow filter. Particles are concentrated inside the oral cavity as filtrate exits between the rakers, but particles are not retained on the rakers. Instead, the high-velocity crossflow along the rakers carries particles away from the raker surfaces and transports the particles towards the oesophagus. This crossflow prevents particles from clogging the gaps between the rakers, and solves the mystery of particle transport from the rakers to the oesophagus.\",TRUE\nCryo-EM Model of the Bullet-Shaped Vesicular Stomatitis Virus,\"VSV in 3D Rhabdoviruses are a family of negative-stranded RNA viruses that includes rabies virus, which have a characteristic bullet shape. Though structures of individual rhabdovirus proteins have been reported, how these are organized into a bullet shape has remained unclear. Now, Ge et al. (p. 689) report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of a model rhabdovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus. The structural data and examination of mutants allows modeling of virion assembly. The structure of a negative-strand RNA virus suggests how bullet-shaped rhabdoviruses assemble. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a bullet-shaped rhabdovirus and a model system of negative-strand RNA viruses. Through direct visualization by means of cryo\u201a\u00c4\u00ecelectron microscopy, we show that each virion contains two nested, left-handed helices: an outer helix of matrix protein M and an inner helix of nucleoprotein N and RNA. M has a hub domain with four contact sites that link to neighboring M and N subunits, providing rigidity by clamping adjacent turns of the nucleocapsid. Side-by-side interactions between neighboring N subunits are critical for the nucleocapsid to form a bullet shape, and structure-based mutagenesis results support this description. Together, our data suggest a mechanism of VSV assembly in which the nucleocapsid spirals from the tip to become the helical trunk, both subsequently framed and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
