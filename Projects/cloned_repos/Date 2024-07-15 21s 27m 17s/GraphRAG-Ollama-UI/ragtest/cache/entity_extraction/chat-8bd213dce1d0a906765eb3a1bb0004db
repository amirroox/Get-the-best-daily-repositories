{"result": " TRUE\nEvidence for self-cleaning in fluid-based smooth and hairy adhesive systems of insects,\"SUMMARY Insects possess adhesive organs that allow attachment to diverse surfaces. Efficient adhesion must be retained throughout their lifetime even when pads are exposed to contamination. Many insects groom their adhesive structures, but it is possible that self-cleaning properties also play an important role. We measured attachment forces of insect pads on glass after contamination with microspheres and found that both smooth pads (stick insects: Carausius morosus) and hairy pads (dock beetles: Gastrophysa viridula) exhibit self-cleaning. Contaminated pads recovered high levels of adhesion after only eight simulated steps; this was accompanied by the deposition of spheres. Self-cleaning was strongly enhanced by shear movements, and only beetle pads showed the ability to self-clean during purely perpendicular pull-offs. Hairy pads also self-cleaned more efficiently than smooth pads for both large (45 \u0152\u00bam) and small (1 \u0152\u00bam) particle sizes. However, the self-cleaning efficiency was higher in beetle pads compared to stick insects. The self-cleaning mechanism is likely due to the fluid-based adhesive system that allows particles to be squeezed out during shear movements or pull-offs.\",TRUE", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

The energy release continues as the multilayered spring slides over the tip of the smooth and lubricated entoglossal process. This sliding\u201a\u00c4\u00ecspring theory predicts that the sheaths deliver most of the instantaneous power required for tongue projection.

Thus, we have identified a unique catapult mechanism that is very different from standard engineering designs. Our morphological and kinematic observations, as well as the available literature data, are consistent with the proposed mechanism of tongue projection, although experimental tests of the sheath strain and the lubrication of the entoglossal process are currently beyond our technical scope.\",TRUE\nEvidence for an elastic projection mechanism in the chameleon tongue,\"To capture prey, chameleons ballistically project their tongues as far as 1.5 body lengths with accelerations of up to 500 m s\u201a\u00e4\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2. At the core of a chameleon's tongue is a cylindrical tongue skeleton surrounded by the accelerator muscle. Previously, the cylindrical accelerator muscle was assumed to power tongue projection directly during the actual fast projection of the tongue. However, high\u201a\u00c4\u00ecspeed recordings of Chamaeleo melleri and C. pardalis reveal that peak powers of 3000 W kg\u201a\u00e4\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1 are necessary to generate the observed accelerations, which exceed the accelerator muscle's capacity by at least five\u201a\u00c4\u00ec to 10\u201a\u00c4\u00ecfold. Extrinsic structures might power projection via the tongue skeleton. High\u201a\u00c4\u00ecspeed fluoroscopy suggests that they contribute less than 10% of the required peak instantaneous power. Thus, the projection power must be generated predominantly within the tongue, and an energy\u201a\u00c4\u00ecstorage\u201a\u00c4\u00ecand\u201a\u00c4\u00ecrelease mechanism must be at work. The key structure in the projection mechanism is probably a cylindrical connective\u201a\u00c4\u00ectissue layer, which surrounds the entoglossal process and was previously suggested to act as lubricating tissue. This tissue layer comprises at least 10 sheaths that envelop the entoglossal process. The outer portion connects anteriorly to the accelerator muscle and the inner portion to the retractor structures. The sheaths contain helical arrays of collagen fibres. Prior to projection, the sheaths are longitudinally loaded by the combined radial contraction and hydrostatic lengthening of the accelerator muscle, at an estimated mean power of 144 W kg\u201a\u00e4\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1 in C. melleri. Tongue projection is triggered as the accelerator muscle and the loaded portions of the sheaths start to slide over the tip of the entoglossal process. The springs relax radially while pushing off the rounded tip of the entoglossal process, making the elastic energy stored in the helical fibres available for a simultaneous forward acceleration of the tongue pad, accelerator muscle and retractor structures. The energy release continues as the multilayered spring slides over the tip of the smooth and lubricated entoglossal process.
