{"result": " The text you provided is a summary of a review on biomimicry in design and technology. It highlights the following points:\n\n1. New materials and technologies, biomimetic creative tools, biomimetic creations with an emphasis on resource savings and sustainability are being developed and applied in various domains such as health, textiles, robotics, materials science, construction, environmental science, and ecology.\n\n2. There is a scarcity of works oriented toward the development and use of everyday objects and services, which are important areas in the design domain. More efforts and investments are required in design projects that clearly and consistently recognize their foundation in the principles of biomimicry.\n\n3. Most of the publications retrieved from the Web of Science originate from engineering and architecture schools and departments. There is a need for more projects produced by teams from schools and departments associated exclusively with the field of design.\n\n4. The trend observed in the present review is that many authors adopt a problem-based approach instead of a solution-driven approach. Supporting the development of more projects and research in design based on the solution-driven approach can enhance creative skills, establish connections with specialists from other areas, and bring designers closer to field research in nature.\n\n5. Biomimetic tools that assist in the planning and execution of creative proposals are being used, but their application is still considered restricted. There was not enough detail on the application of such instruments in the analyzed literature.\n\n6. The TEMAC model was used to identify the main themes, approaches, and trends in the literature, allowing comparisons to be made between the works and production of different authors, countries, and institutions.\n\nThe text concludes with a mention that this review provides recommendations for future research in biomimicry, particularly focusing on everyday objects and services, and emphasizing the need for more projects produced by teams from schools and departments associated exclusively with the field of design. It also suggests the importance of adopting a solution-driven approach and using biomimetic tools more frequently in creative design processes.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

In this sense, it is pertinent to mention that the publications, which were listed and organized in this review, reflect development in several areas of cutting-edge technology, which is consistent with the innovative tendency intrinsic to the field of biomimicry.\n\nHowever, it is relevant to underscore that there is still a scarcity of works oriented toward the development and use of everyday objects and in the field of services, given that these are two areas of great importance in the design domain. In view of this finding, it is reasonable to assume that more efforts and investments are required in design projects that clearly and consistently recognize their foundation in the principles of biomimicry.\n\nThus, it is crucial to more frequently adopt a biomimicry perspective to research and develop products intended for the daily lives of consumers, in order to guarantee a better quality of life for the users of these objects (e.g., bio-inspired functional and technological improvements of products). This limitation is even more alarming upon verifying that most of the publications retrieved from the Web of Science originate from engineering and architecture schools and departments. As a result, there are not enough projects produced by teams from schools and departments associated exclusively with the field of design. It is possible to assume that the absence of the \u2018design\u2019 filter when searching the Web of Science may constitute a restriction for specific dissemination of works.\n\nAnother trend observed in the present review, highlighted by the analysis of the heat maps, concerns which type of biomimicry-based approach the authors adopted in their projects and research. The results indicated that many of them started by addressing the problem and the required function (problem-based approach) instead of beginning directly from the investigation of natural aspects (solution-driven approach). It should be clarified that this could be expected since the survey encompassed the field of design, an area where projects and creative processes commonly begin with the definition of a problem or a challenge associated with human activity. However, supporting the development of more projects and research in design based on the solution-driven approach can also be of great interest, as it can contribute to enhancing and refining creative skills. In addition, this approach contributes to establishing connections with specialists from other areas (e.g., biologists) and may also help bring designers closer to field research in nature.\n\nRegarding design processes, efforts were made to provide information about biomimetic tools that assist in the planning and execution of creative proposals (e.g., Biomimicry Thinking Design Lens, Biomimicry Taxonomy Chart, BioTRIZ, GEMS of SAPPhIRE, IDEA-INSPIRE, BECE-Framework) [9,15, 30,35,37,38]. Such instruments, connected to the problem-based approach, mainly focus on the conceptual development phase of the project, supporting the investigation of characteristics of nature in their transposition into the design domain. In addition, various digital resources were explored by the authors to generate complex shapes and patterns for models and products (e.g., parametric software and rapid prototyping). The use of biomimetic tools in creative design processes, reported in the analyzed literature, can still be considered restricted, given that there was not enough detail on the application of such instruments. Consequently, it was not possible to verify, in this review, whether the authors resorted to other resources or documents, or if they deliberately chose not to include this information in the communication of their works.\n\nThe TEMAC model contributed to the identification of the main themes, approaches, and trends in the literature. Through it, it was possible to infer which areas are expanding and which deserve to be further investigated. The tool also allowed comparisons to be made between the works and production of different authors, countries, and institutions.\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n13 of 16\n\nIn addition, the recommendation of TEMAC\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
