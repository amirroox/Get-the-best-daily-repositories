{"result": " All the statements provided are true based on the information available in scientific literature. Here's a brief explanation for each:\n\n1. Green colored wing patches in certain butterflies: The green coloration is due to a combination of bile pigment and carotenoid lutein, which improves camouflage. The dorsal forewings have bristles instead of scales on the colored patches, while the ventral side has transparent or diffusely scattering scales that enhance wing coloration when illuminated from the dorsal side. These glass scales also create polarized iridescence for intraspecific signaling.\n\n2. Calcitic microlenses as part of the photoreceptor system in brittlestars: Certain calcite crystals used for skeletal construction in brittlestars are also a component of specialized photosensory organs, resembling a compound eye. These structures have a double-lens design and guide light inside the tissue to nerve bundles, which are presumed primary photoreceptors. The lens array minimizes spherical aberration and birefringence and detects light from a particular direction.\n\n3. Campylobacter jejuni motility integrates specialized cell shape, flagellar filament, and motor: C. jejuni rotates a flagellum at each pole to swim through the viscous mucosa of its hosts' gastrointestinal tracts. The bacterium coordinates rotation of these two opposing flagella by wrapping the leading filament around the cell body during swimming in high-viscosity media, and its differentiated flagellar filament and helical body have evolved to facilitate this wrapped-mode swimming.\n\n4. Capillarity-based switchable adhesion: A switchable adhesion device has been engineered that combines capillarity-based adhesion (surface tension force from a large number of small liquid bridges) and switchability (electronic control to make or break contacts quickly). The device can grab or release a substrate in a fraction of a second via low-voltage pulses, consuming minimal energy. Notably, the device maintains the integrity of an array of distinct interfaces during active reconfiguration from droplets to bridges and back.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

Pairs joining a colonial nesting abbreviate their initial phase, presumably by exploiting a pioneer pair's bubble raft, thereby reducing energy and material expenditure, and time exposed to predators. Finally, eggs are deposited only in the centre of nests with a continuously produced, approximately 1 cm deep egg-free cortex that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests.\",TRUE\nButterfly wing colors: glass scales of Graphium sarpedon cause polarized iridescence and enhance blue/green pigment coloration of the wing membrane,\"SUMMARY The wings of the swordtail butterfly Graphium sarpedon nipponum contain the bile pigment sarpedobilin, which causes blue/green colored wing patches. Locally the bile pigment is combined with the strongly blue-absorbing carotenoid lutein, resulting in green wing patches and thus improving camouflage. In the dorsal forewings, the colored patches lack the usual wing scales, but instead have bristles. We have found that on the ventral side most of these patches have very transparent scales that enhance, by reflection, the wing coloration when illuminated from the dorsal side. These glass scales furthermore create a strongly polarized iridescence when illuminated by obliquely incident light from the ventral side, presumably for intraspecific signaling. A few ventral forewing patches have diffusely scattering, white scales that also enhance the blue/green wing coloration when observed from the dorsal side.\",TRUE\nCalcitic microlenses as part of the photoreceptor system in brittlestars,\"Photosensitivity in most echinoderms has been attributed to \u201a\u00c4\u00f2diffuse\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 dermal receptors. Here we report that certain single calcite crystals used by brittlestars for skeletal construction are also a component of specialized photosensory organs, conceivably with the function of a compound eye. The analysis of arm ossicles in Ophiocoma showed that in light-sensitive species, the periphery of the labyrinthic calcitic skeleton extends into a regular array of spherical microstructures that have a characteristic double-lens design. These structures are absent in light-indifferent species. Photolithographic experiments in which a photoresist film was illuminated through the lens array showed selective exposure of the photoresist under the lens centres. These results provide experimental evidence that the microlenses are optical elements that guide and focus the light inside the tissue. The estimated focal distance (4\u201a\u00c4\u00ec7\u201a\u00c4\u00e2\u00ac\u00b5m below the lenses) coincides with the location of\u00ac\u2020nerve bundles\u201a\u00c4\u00eethe presumed primary photoreceptors. The lens array is designed to minimize spherical aberration and birefringence and to detect light from a particular direction. The optical performance is further optimized by phototropic chromatophores that regulate the dose of illumination reaching the receptors. These structures represent an example of a multifunctional biomaterial that fulfills both mechanical and optical functions.\",TRUE\n\"Campylobacter jejuni motility integrates specialized cell shape, flagellar filament, and motor, to coordinate action of its opposed flagella\",\"Campylobacter jejuni rotates a flagellum at each pole to swim through the viscous mucosa of its hosts\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 gastrointestinal tracts. Despite their importance for host colonization, however, how C. jejuni coordinates rotation of these two opposing flagella is unclear. As well as their polar placement, C. jejuni\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s flagella deviate from the norm of Enterobacteriaceae in other ways: their flagellar motors produce much higher torque and their flagellar filament is made of two different zones of two different flagellins. To understand how C. jejuni\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s opposed motors coordinate, and what contribution these factors play in C. jejuni motility, we developed strains with flagella that could be fluorescently labeled, and observed them by high-speed video microscopy. We found that C. jejuni coordinates its dual flagella by wrapping the leading filament around the cell body during swimming in high-viscosity media and that its differentiated flagellar filament and helical body have evolved to facilitate this wrapped-mode swimming.\",TRUE\nCapillarity-based switchable adhesion,\"Drawing inspiration from the adhesion abilities of a leaf beetle found in nature, we have engineered a switchable adhesion device. The device combines two concepts: The surface tension force from a large number of small liquid bridges can be significant (capillarity-based adhesion) and these contacts can be quickly made or broken with electronic control (switchable). The device grabs or releases a substrate in a fraction of a second via a low-voltage pulse that drives electroosmotic flow. Energy consumption is minimal because both the grabbed and released states are stable equilibria that persist with no energy added to the system. Notably, the device maintains the integrity of an array of hundreds to thousands of distinct interfaces during active reconfiguration from droplets to bridges and back, despite the natural tendency of the liquid toward coalescence.
