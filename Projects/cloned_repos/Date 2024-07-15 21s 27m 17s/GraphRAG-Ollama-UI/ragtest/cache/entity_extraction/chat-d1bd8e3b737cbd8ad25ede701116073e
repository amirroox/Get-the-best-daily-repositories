{"result": " All the provided texts describe studies on collective behavior and computation in various animal species, including cows, toothfish, spider monkeys, songbirds, and honeybees. The studies explore different aspects such as protein interactions, social structure adaptation, decision-making rules, and collective ventilation.\n\n1. The first text discusses the interaction between crystallins from cow and toothfish lenses, suggesting that toothfish \u0152\u2265 may have adaptive changes that affect its ability to interact with tuna \u0152\u00b1 crystallins.\n\n2. The second text investigates how spider monkeys use social knowledge to collectively compute subgroup size distributions adaptive for foraging in variable environments. It suggests that the monkeys decide to stay or go using information from multiple individuals and can collectively compute a distribution of subgroup size that makes efficient use of ephemeral sources of nutrition.\n\n3. The third text studies collective behavior in flocks of five species of woodland passerine birds, demonstrating highly synchronized feeding behavior within patches. It also explores the underlying decision rule birds may be using when foraging in mixed-species flocks and finds that species differ in their response to the distribution of conspecifics and heterospecifics across foraging patches.\n\n4. The last text focuses on active ventilation in honeybee nests, showing that colonies with relatively large nest cavities are actively ventilated by bees fanning their wings at the nest entrance when the local air temperature exceeds a threshold.\n\nThese studies highlight the complexity and adaptability of collective behavior in various animal species, providing insights into how animals make decisions, interact socially, and respond to environmental changes.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

Dynamic light scattering measured an increase in size of \u0152\u00b1\u0152\u2265 crystallin mixtures upon heating, which supports formation of the \u0152\u00b1\u0152\u2265 complex as an integral part of the chaperone process. Surprisingly, in cross-species chaperone assays, tuna\u0152\u00b1 crystallins only partly protected toothfish \u0152\u2265 crystallins, while cow \u0152\u00b1 crystallins completely failed to protect, indicating partial and no \u0152\u00b1\u0152\u2265 interaction, respectively. Toothfish \u0152\u2265 was likely to be the component that failed to interact, as the supernatant from a cow\u0152\u00b1 plus toothfish \u0152\u2265 incubation could chaperone cow \u0152\u2265 crystallins in a subsequent heat incubation, indicating the presence of uncomplexed cow \u0152\u00b1. This suggests that the inability of toothfish \u0152\u2265 crystallins to fully complex with tuna \u0152\u00b1, and not at all with the cow\u0152\u00b1 crystallins, may have its basis in adaptive changes in the protein that relate to the extreme cold-stability of the toothfish lens.\",TRUE\nCollective Computation in Animal Fission-Fusion Dynamics,\"Recent work suggests that collective computation of social structure can minimize uncertainty about the social and physical environment, facilitating adaptation. We explore these ideas by studying how fission-fusion social structure arises in spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) groups, exploring whether monkeys use social knowledge to collectively compute subgroup size distributions adaptive for foraging in variable environments. We assess whether individual decisions to stay in or leave subgroups are conditioned on strategies based on the presence or absence of others. We search for this evidence in a time series of subgroup membership. We find that individuals have multiple strategies, suggesting that the social knowledge of different individuals is important. These stay-leave strategies provide microscopic inputs to a stochastic model of collective computation encoded in a family of circuits. Each circuit represents an hypothesis for how collectives combine strategies to make decisions, and how these produce various subgroup size distributions. By running these circuits forward in simulation we generate new subgroup size distributions and measure how well they match food abundance in the environment using transfer entropies. We find that spider monkeys decide to stay or go using information from multiple individuals and that they can collectively compute a distribution of subgroup size that makes efficient use of ephemeral sources of nutrition. We are able to artificially tune circuits with subgroup size distributions that are a better fit to the environment than the observed. This suggests that a combination of measurement error, constraint, and adaptive lag are diminishing the power of collective computation in this system. These results are relevant for a more general understanding of the emergence of ordered states in multi-scale social systems with adaptive properties\u201a\u00c4\u00ecboth natural and engineered.\",TRUE\nCollective decision making and social interaction rules in mixed-species flocks of songbirds,\"Associations in mixed-species foraging groups are common in animals, yet have rarely been explored in the context of collective behaviour. Despite many investigations into the social and ecological conditions under which individuals should form groups, we still know little about the specific behavioural rules that individuals adopt in these contexts, or whether these can be generalized to heterospecifics. Here, we studied collective behaviour in flocks in a community of five species of woodland passerine birds. We adopted an automated data collection protocol, involving visits by RFID-tagged birds to feeding stations equipped with antennae, over two winters, recording 91\u201a\u00c4\u00e0576 feeding events by 1904 individuals. We demonstrated highly synchronized feeding behaviour within patches, with birds moving towards areas of the patch with the largest proportion of the flock. Using a model of collective decision making, we then explored the underlying decision rule birds may be using when foraging in mixed-species flocks. The model tested whether birds used a different decision rule for conspecifics and heterospecifics, and whether the rules used by individuals of different species varied. We found that species differed in their response to the distribution of conspecifics and heterospecifics across foraging patches. However, simulating decisions using the different rules, which reproduced our data well, suggested that the outcome of using different decision rules by each species resulted in qualitatively similar overall patterns of movement. It is possible that the decision rules each species uses may be adjusted to variation in mean species abundance in order for individuals to maintain the same overall flock-level response. This is likely to be important for maintaining coordinated behaviour across species, and to result in quick and adaptive flock responses to food resources that are patchily distributed in space and time.\",TRUE\nCollective ventilation in honeybee nests,\"European honey bees (Apis mellifera) live in large congested nest cavities with a single opening that limits passive ventilation.
