The researchers found that carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed hydration of CO2 is central to the acquisition of both shell-forming ions, providing hydrogen ions for electrogenic vacuolar-type H+-ATPase that fuels Ca2+ uptake and possibly a Ca2+/1H+ exchanger. Additionally, CO2 hydration provides an endogenous source of HCO3-, forming HCO3- for calcification while hydrogen ions are excreted, contributing to continued Ca2+ uptake and creating favorable alkaline internal conditions for calcification.\n\n2. \"Charging the Batteries to Heal Wounds through PI3K\" - This study shows that manipulation of electric fields in wounds affects wound healing in vivo and identifies the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway as a key component of cell migration in response to electric cues.\n\n3. \"Chromatic Neuronal Jamming in a Primitive Brain\" - This study demonstrates that neurons of distinct types form independent percolating networks barring any physical contact in the brain of the flatworm planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, creating a distinct packing state called 'chromatic' jamming. The researchers suggest that this jammed state may extend to describe cell packing in similarly complex tissues composed of multiple cell types.\n\n4. \"Circumferential Spicule Growth by Pericellular Silica Deposition in the Hexactinellid Sponge Monorhaphis chuni\" - This study investigates the formation of outer lamellae on a cellular level in the giant basal spicule of the hexactinellid sponge Monorhaphis chuni. It is shown that the formation of an outermost lamella begins with the association of cell clusters with the surface of the thickening and/or growing spicule, and the cells release silica for controlled formation of a lamella. The pericellular (silica) material fuses to a delimited and textured layer of silica with depressions approximately 20-30 \u00b5m in diameter. The newly formed layer initially displays well-structured banded ribbons and only attains its plain surface in a final step. The chemical composition in the depressions was studied using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and by staining with Texas Red, suggesting that those depressions are the nests for the silica formation.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

This development is impaired by removal of ambient total calcium but not by removal of bicarbonate and/or carbonate. In this study we utilized pharmacological agents to target possible acquisition pathways for both Ca2+ and accumulation of carbonate in post-metamorphic, shell-laying embryos. Using whole egg mass flux measurements and ion-specific microelectrode analytical techniques, we have demonstrated that carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed hydration of CO2 is central in the acquisition of both shell-forming ions because it provides the hydrogen ions for an electrogenic vacuolar-type H+-ATPase that fuels the uptake of Ca2+ via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and possibly an electrogenic Ca2+/1H+ exchanger. Additionally, CO2 hydration provides an endogenous source of HCO \u201a\u00c4\u00ec3. Thus, hydration of endogenous CO2 forms HCO \u201a\u00c4\u00ec3 for calcification while hydrogen ions are excreted, contributing to continued Ca2+ uptake, as well as creating favorable alkaline internal conditions for calcification. The connections between Ca2+ and HCO \u201a\u00c4\u00ec3 acquisition mechanisms that we describe here provide new insight into this efficient, embryonic calcification in freshwater.\",TRUE\nCharging the batteries to heal wounds through PI3K,\"Endogenous electric fields in wounds have been documented for centuries, but they have received little attention from the scientific community. A new study shows that manipulation of these electric fields affects wound healing in vivo and identifies the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway as a key component of cell migration in response to electric cues.\",TRUE\nChromatic neuronal jamming in a primitive brain,\"Jamming models developed in inanimate matter have been widely used to describe cell packing in tissues 1 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 7 , but predominantly neglect cell diversity, despite its prevalence in biology. Most tissues, animal brains in particular, comprise a mix of many cell types, with mounting evidence suggesting that neurons can recognize their respective types as they organize in space 8 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 11 . How cell diversity revises the current jamming paradigm is unknown. Here, in the brain of the flatworm planarian Schmidtea mediterranea , which exhibits remarkable tissue plasticity within a simple, quantifiable nervous system 12 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 16 , we identify a distinct packing state, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2chromatic\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 jamming. Combining experiments with computational modelling, we show that neurons of distinct types form independent percolating networks barring any physical contact. This jammed state emerges as cell packing configurations become constrained by cell type-specific interactions and therefore may extend to describe cell packing in similarly complex tissues composed of multiple cell types. An imaging study of planarian flatworm brains demonstrates that densely packed neural tissues seem to have packing configurations commensurate with a jammed state.\",TRUE\nCircumferential spicule growth by pericellular silica deposition in the hexactinellid sponge Monorhaphis chuni,\"SUMMARY The giant basal spicule of the hexactinellid sponge Monorhaphis chuni represents the longest natural siliceous structure on Earth. This spicule is composed of concentrically arranged lamellae that are approximately 10 \u0152\u00bam thick. In the present study, we investigated the formation of outer lamellae on a cellular level using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. It is shown that the formation of an outermost lamella begins with the association of cell clusters with the surface of the thickening and/or growing spicule. The cells release silica for controlled formation of a lamella. The pericellular (silica) material fuses to a delimited and textured layer of silica with depressions approximately 20\u201a\u00c4\u00ec30 \u0152\u00bam in diameter. The newly formed layer initially displays 40 \u0152\u00bam wide, well-structured banded ribbons and only attains its plain surface in a final step.
