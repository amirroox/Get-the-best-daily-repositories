During a tandem run, a single leader teaches one follower the route to important resources such as sources of food or better nest sites. In the present study, we investigate what tandem leaders and followers do, in the context of nest emigration, if their partner goes missing. Our experiments involved removing either leaders or followers at set points during tandem runs. Former leaders first stand still and wait for their missing follower but then most often proceed alone to the new nest site. By contrast, former followers often first engage in a Brownian search, for almost exactly the time that their former leader should have waited for them, and then former followers switch to a superdiffusive search. In this way, former followers first search their immediate neighbourhood for their lost leader before becoming ever more wide ranging so that in the absence of their former leader they can often find the new nest, re-encounter the old one or meet a new leader. We also show that followers gain useful information even from incomplete tandem runs. These observations point to the important principle that sophisticated communication behaviours may have evolved as anytime algorithms, i.e. procedures that are beneficial even if they do not run to completion.\",TRUE\nAnt semiochemicals limit apterous aphid dispersal,\"Some organisms can manipulate the nervous systems of others or alter their physiology in order to obtain benefit. Ants are known to limit alate aphid dispersal by physically removing wings and also through chemical manipulation of the alate developmental pathway. This results in reduced dispersal and higher local densities of aphids, which benefit ants in terms of increased honeydew and prey availability. Here, we show that the walking movement of mutualistic apterous aphids is also reduced by ant semiochemicals. Aphids walk slower and their dispersal from an unsuitable patch is hampered by ants. If aphid walking dispersal has evolved as a means of natural enemy escape, then ant chemicals may act as a signal indicating protection; hence, reduced dispersal could be adaptive for aphids. If, however, dispersal is primarily a means to reduce competition or to maintain persistent metapopulations, then manipulation by ants could be detrimental. Such manipulation strategies, common in host\u201a\u00c4\u00ecparasite and predator\u201a\u00c4\u00ecprey interactions, may be more common in mutualism than expected.\",TRUE\n\"Antibacterial properties of larval secretions of the blowfly, Lucilia sericata\",\"Abstract.\u201a\u00c4\u00c7 The antibacterial properties of secretions aseptically collected from larvae of the greenbottle fly Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) were examined. These investigations revealed the presence of small (<1\u201a\u00c4\u00c9kDa) antibacterial factor(s) within the larval secretions, active against a range of bacteria. These include the Gram\u201a\u00c4\u00eapositive Staphylococcus aureus, both methicillin\u201a\u00c4\u00earesistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin\u201a\u00c4\u00easensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and to a lesser extent the Gram\u201a\u00c4\u00eanegative Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These secretions were shown to be highly stable as a freeze\u201a\u00c4\u00eadried preparation and, considering the activity against organisms typically associated with clinical infection, may be a source of novel antibiotic\u201a\u00c4\u00ealike compounds that may be used for infection control and in the fight against MRSA.\",TRUE\nAntifreeze activity of Antarctic fish glycoprotein and a synthetic polymer,\"Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) and proteins isolated from the sera of some polar fish species and overwintering insects are able to depress the freezing temperature of the aqueous body fluids (and of water) by means of a non-col ligative mechanism1,2. All previous measurements of the antifreeze effect have been performed on bulk samples under conditions where ice nucleation would be catalysed by participate impurities, giving limited and indeterminate degrees of undercooling. We report the first measurements of homogeneous (spontaneous) ice nucleation rates in deeply under-cooled (<233 K) solutions of AFGP and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), a well-characterized polymer which finds use as a cryoprotectant. Antifreeze activity is said3 to derive from the sorption of AFGP molecules on the active growth sites of ice crystals, preventing normal growth and inducing unusual crystal habits. We have performed experiments on the inhibition of ice crystal growth in solutions containing AFGP and PVP under standardized conditions, and find that the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
