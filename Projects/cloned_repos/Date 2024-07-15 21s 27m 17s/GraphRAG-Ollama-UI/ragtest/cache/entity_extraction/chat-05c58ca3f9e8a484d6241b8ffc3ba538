Our work indicates that companion planting short vine tomatoes with French marigolds throughout the growing season will slow development of whitefly populations. Introducing marigolds to unprotected tomatoes after significant whitefly build-up will be less effective. The use of limonene dispensers placed near to tomato plants also shows promise. It is argued that this work supports the possibility of the development of a mixture of tomato companion plants that infer \u201a\u00c4\u00f2associational resistance\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 against many major invertebrate pests of tomato. Such a mixture, if comprising edible or ornamental plants, would be economically viable, would reduce the need for additional chemical and biological control, and, if used outdoors, would generate plant-diverse agro-ecosystems that are better able to harbour invertebrate wildlife.\",TRUE\nComparative jet wake structure and swimming performance of salps,\"SUMMARY Salps are barrel-shaped marine invertebrates that swim by jet propulsion. Morphological variations among species and life-cycle stages are accompanied by differences in swimming mode. The goal of this investigation was to compare propulsive jet wakes and swimming performance variables among morphologically distinct salp species (Pegea confoederata, Weelia (Salpa) cylindrica, Cyclosalpa sp.) and relate swimming patterns to ecological function. Using a combination of in situ dye visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements, we describe properties of the jet wake and swimming performance variables including thrust, drag and propulsive efficiency. Locomotion by all species investigated was achieved via vortex ring propulsion. The slow-swimming P. confoederata produced the highest weight-specific thrust (T=53 N kg\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1) and swam with the highest whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (\u0152\u2211wc=55%). The fast-swimming W. cylindrica had the most streamlined body shape but produced an intermediate weight-specific thrust (T=30 N kg\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1) and swam with an intermediate whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (\u0152\u2211wc=52%). Weak swimming performance variables in the slow-swimming C. affinis, including the lowest weight-specific thrust (T=25 N kg\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1) and lowest whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (\u0152\u2211wc=47%), may be compensated by low energetic requirements. Swimming performance variables are considered in the context of ecological roles and evolutionary relationships.\",TRUE\n\"Comparative overwintering physiology of Alaska and Indiana populations of the beetle Cucujus clavipes (Fabricius): roles of antifreeze proteins, polyols, dehydration and diapause\",\"SUMMARY The beetle Cucujus clavipes is found in North America over a broad latitudinal range from North Carolina (latitude \u201a\u00e0\u00ba35\u00ac\u221eN) to near tree line in the Brooks Range in Alaska (latitude, \u201a\u00e0\u00ba67\u00ac\u221e30\u201a\u00c4\u2264 N). The cold adaptations of populations from northern Indiana (\u201a\u00e0\u00ba41\u00ac\u221e45\u201a\u00c4\u2264 N) and Alaska were compared and, as expected, the supercooling points (the temperatures at which they froze) of these freeze-avoiding insects were significantly lower in Alaska insects. Both populations produce glycerol, but the concentrations in Alaska larvae were much higher than in Indiana insects (\u201a\u00e0\u00ba2.2 and 0.5 mol l\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1, respectively). In addition, both populations produce antifreeze proteins. Interestingly, in the autumn both populations have the same approximate level of hemolymph thermal hysteresis, indicative of antifreeze protein activity, suggesting that they synthesize similar amounts of antifreeze protein. A major difference is that the Alaska larvae undergo extreme dehydration in winter wherein water content decreases from 63\u201a\u00c4\u00ec65% body water (1.70\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1.85 g H2O g\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1 dry mass) in summer to 28\u201a\u00c4\u00ec40% body water (0.40\u201a\u00c4\u00ec0.68 g H2O g\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1 dry mass) in winter. These 2.5\u201a\u00c4\u00ec4.6-fold reductions in body water greatly increase the concentrations of antifreeze in the Alaska insects. Glycerol concentrations would increase to 7\u201a\u00c4\u00ec10 mol l\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1 while thermal hysteresis increased to nearly 13\u00ac\u221eC (the highest ever measured in any organism) in concentrated hemolymph. By contrast, Indiana larvae do not desiccate in winter. The Alaska population also undergoes a diapause while insects from Indiana do not. The result of these, and likely additional, adaptations is that while the mean winter supercooling points of Indiana larvae were approximately \u201a\u00c4\u00ec23\u00ac\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
