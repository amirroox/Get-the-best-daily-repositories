The involvement of extracellular fungal peroxidases such as manganese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase (Phenol oxidase) in the degradation of fluoranthene was studied. On the eighth day of incubation 54.09% of 70\u00ac\u2020mg l\u201a\u00e0\u00ed1 fluoranthene was removed. There after no PAHs removal was observed till the 20th day of the incubation period. The isolate was identified as Pleurotus ostreatus by 18S rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, and partial 28S rRNA gene sequencing. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time Pleurotus ostreatus have been reported to degrade such a high concentration of fluoranthene within much lower time period of incubation. Depletion in the residual fluoranthene in the culture medium was determined by HPLC. Attempts were made to identify the degradation product in the culture medium with the help of FT-IR, NMR, and HPTLC analysis. In the present study positive correlation between fluoranthene degradation and the ligninolytic enzyme (MnP and laccase) production is observed, thus this isolate can play an effective role for bioremediation of PAHs contaminated sites.\",TRUE\nBiodegradation of new quaternary ammonium compounds in treated wood by mould fungi,\"The degradation of seven potential wood preservatives based on imidazolium compounds (ICs) and quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) with a modified anion structure by mould fungi was determined using soil-block method. Experiments were carried out on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) wood. Two-phase titration and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method were used to detect and quantify the degradation products. The performed soil-block tests showed that the ICs and QACs with alkoxymethyl substituents were leached from the experimental wood when in contact with moist soil and revealed their fungal detoxification by mould fungi, especially by Gliocladium roseum. The degree of biological decomposition of new compounds was higher than didecyldimethylammonium chloride and didecylmethylpoli(oxyethyl)ammonium propionate. The observations of the colonization by mould fungi were made using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Decay of treated wood by mould fungi showed its tolerance to QACs.\",TRUE\nBiodegradation of volatile organic compounds by five fungal species,\"Abstract. Five fungal species, Cladosporium resinae (ATCC 34066), Cladosporium sphaerospermum (ATCC 200384), Exophiala lecanii-corni (CBS 102400), Mucor rouxii (ATCC 44260), and Phanerochaete chrysosporium (ATCC 24725), were tested for their ability to degrade nine compounds commonly found in industrial off-gas emissions. Fungal cultures inoculated on ceramic support media were provided with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via the vapor phase as their sole carbon and energy sources. Compounds tested included aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and styrene), ketones (methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and methyl propyl ketone), and organic acids (n-butyl acetate, ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate). Experiments were conducted using three pH values ranging from 3.5 to 6.5. Fungal ability to degrade each VOC was determined by observing the presence or absence of visible growth on the ceramic support medium during a 30-day test period. Results indicate that E. lecanii-corni and C. sphaerospermum can readily utilize each of the nine VOCs as a sole carbon and energy source. P. chrysosporium was able to degrade all VOCs tested except for styrene under the conditions imposed. C. resinae was able to degrade both organic acids, all of the ketones, and some of the aromatic compounds (ethylbenzene and toluene); however, it was not able to grow utilizing benzene or styrene under the conditions tested. With the VOCs tested, M. rouxii produced visible growth only when supplied with n-butyl acetate or ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate. Maximum growth for most fungi was observed at a pH of approximately 5.0. The experimental protocol utilized in these studies is a useful tool for assessing the ability of different fungal species to degrade gas-phase VOCs under conditions expected in a biofilter application.\",TRUE\nBiofouling: lessons from nature,\"Biofouling is generally undesirable for many applications.
