{"result": " The biological strategy discussed here is heliotropism, specifically in plants like flowers, which orient themselves towards the sun. This strategy allows plants to optimize their exposure to sunlight for photosynthesis.\n\nKey Points:\n1. Heliotropism is a type of tropism that causes plants to grow or change their shape in response to sunlight.\n2. Auxin hormones play a crucial role in phototropism, causing the shoot to bend towards the sun.\n3. The plant continues to orient itself according to its needs and the environment, although it may not align perfectly with the sun due to other factors.\n4. Understanding heliotropism can inspire the development of more sustainable technologies for harnessing solar energy, such as self-directing solar panels that mimic the movement of plants to face the sun.\n5. Another biological strategy discussed is how wetland plants, like common reeds, transport gases through a network of spaces between their cells to overcome the challenge of growing in waterlogged soil. This strategy can inspire technologies for distributing and expelling gases in various applications.\n\nReferences:\n1. Sherry, R. A., & Galen, C. (2003).
