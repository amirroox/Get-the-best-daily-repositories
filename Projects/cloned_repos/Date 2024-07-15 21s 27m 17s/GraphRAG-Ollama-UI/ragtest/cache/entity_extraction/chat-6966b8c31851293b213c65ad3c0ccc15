{"result": " Based on the information provided, here's a summary of the key findings regarding publications about design and biomimicry:\n\n1. The years with the highest number of publications were 2019 (n=27), 2016 (n=26), and 2020 (n=24).\n\n2. The three countries with the highest number of publications were the United States, United Kingdom, and Turkey.\n\n3. The journals that published the highest number of works on this subject were WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment, Scientific Reports, Architectural Science Review, and Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences.\n\n4. Regarding institutions associated with publications about interconnections between design and biomimicry, the University of California System, Victoria University of Wellington, University System of Georgia, Delft University of Technology, and University of Akron stood out.\n\n5. Maibritt Pedersen Zari was the author with the most published works (n=8), followed by Donnison, Faludi, Jones, Niewiarowski, and Pauw (n=3).\n\n6. Some notable works with 35 or more citations registered in the Web of Science between 1991 and 2021 include \"Biomimetics: lessons from nature\u2014an overview\" [26], \"Biomimicry in textiles: past, present, and potential\" [27], \"Microstructured barbs on the North American porcupine quill\" [28], \"Design and fabrication of multi-material structures for bioinspired robots\" [29], and \"Integrating backcasting and eco-design for the circular economy.
