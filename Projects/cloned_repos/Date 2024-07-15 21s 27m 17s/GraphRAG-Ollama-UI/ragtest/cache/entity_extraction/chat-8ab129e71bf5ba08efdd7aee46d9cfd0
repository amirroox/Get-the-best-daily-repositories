{"result": " The biological strategy described here is how birds breathe, specifically focusing on the unidirectional flow of air through their respiratory system. This design allows for a greater proportion of fresh air to come into contact with the gas exchange surfaces in the lungs, enhancing oxygen intake and carbon dioxide expulsion.\n\nDuring inhalation, air enters through the trachea and flows into the lungs and posterior air sacs, displacing stale air from the anterior air sacs. During exhalation, fresh air from the posterior air sacs moves out through the bronchus and trachea, while spent air from the lungs is expelled into the anterior air sacs. This pattern creates a unidirectional flow of fresh air over the gas exchange surfaces in the lungs, allowing for continuous gas exchange within the lungs.\n\nThis contrasts with mammalian lungs, which experience bidirectional airflow over the gas exchange surfaces. The efficiency of the avian respiratory system is attributed to its unidirectional nature and the structure of its parabronchial system (the smaller passages within the lungs). The air capillaries in the walls of the parabronchial system have a much larger overall surface area than that found in the mammalian respiratory system, which allows for more efficient gas exchange.\n\nThis summary features contributions from Alex Uhrich and can be found on AskNature: https://asknature.org/how-birds-breathe\n\nReferences:\n- Gill, Frank B.
