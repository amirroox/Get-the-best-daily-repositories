{"result": " The study aimed to investigate if the in vivo force-length behavior, work, and elastic energy savings of distal muscle-tendon units in tammar wallabies' legs change during level versus incline hopping. To achieve this, they measured muscle activation (electromyography), fascicle strain (sonomicrometry), and muscle-tendon force (tendon buckles) from the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and plantaris (PL) muscles of tammar wallabies trained to hop on a level and an inclined treadmill at two speeds.\n\nThe results showed similar patterns of muscle activation, force, and fascicle strain under both level and incline conditions, corresponding to similar limb timing and movement. During both level and incline hopping, the LG and PL exhibited low levels of net fascicle strain and muscle work, with no significant changes between the two conditions. The PL showed shorter but more intense periods of activation during incline versus level hopping, while the LG's electromyographic (EMG) phase, duration, and intensity did not differ.\n\nIn conclusion, the study indicates that design for spring-like tendon energy savings and economical muscle force generation is crucial for these two distal muscle-tendon units of the tammar wallaby. The need to accommodate changes in work associated with level versus incline locomotion is achieved by more proximal muscles of the limb.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

However, not all sex-specific features are static: for example, C.\u00ac\u2020elegans males (XO) can sometimes exhibit hermaphrodite (XX)-like feeding behavior [1, 2]. (C.\u00ac\u2020elegans hermaphrodites are somatic females that transiently produce self-sperm.) Essentially all somatic sex differences in C.\u00ac\u2020elegans are governed by the master regulator tra-1, whose activity is controlled by chromosomal sex and is necessary and sufficient to specify the hermaphrodite state [3]. One aspect of this state is high expression of the chemoreceptor odr-10. In hermaphrodites, high odr-10 expression promotes feeding, but in males, low odr-10 expression facilitates exploration [4]. However, males suppress this sex difference in two contexts: juvenile males exhibit high odr-10 expression and food deprivation activates odr-10 in adult males [4-6]. Remarkably, we find that both of these phenomena require tra-1. In juvenile (L3) males, tra-1 is expressed in numerous neurons; this expression diminishes as individuals mature into adulthood, a process that requires conserved regulators of sexual maturation. tra-1 remains expressed in a small number of neurons in adult males, where it likely has a permissive role in odr-10 activation. Thus, the neuronal functions of tra-1 are not limited to hermaphrodites; rather, tra-1 also acts in the male nervous system to transiently suppress a sexual dimorphism, developmentally and in response to nutritional stress. Our results show that the molecular and functional representation of sexual state in C.\u00ac\u2020elegans is neither static nor homogeneous, challenging traditional notions about the nature of biological sex.\",TRUE\nDynamics of leg muscle function in tammar wallabies (M. eugenii) during level versus incline hopping,\"SUMMARY The goal of our study was to examine whether the in vivo force-length behavior, work and elastic energy savings of distal muscle-tendon units in the legs of tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) change during level versus incline hopping. To address this question, we obtained measurements of muscle activation (via electromyography), fascicle strain (via sonomicrometry) and muscle-tendon force (via tendon buckles) from the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and plantaris (PL) muscles of tammar wallabies trained to hop on a level and an inclined (10\u00ac\u221e, 17.4% grade) treadmill at two speeds (3.3 m s-1 and 4.2 m s-1). Similar patterns of muscle activation, force and fascicle strain were observed under both level and incline conditions. This also corresponded to similar patterns of limb timing and movement (duty factor, limb contact time and hopping frequency). During both level and incline hopping, the LG and PL exhibited patterns of fascicle stretch and shortening that yielded low levels of net fascicle strain [LG: level, -1.0\u00ac\u00b14.6% (mean \u00ac\u00b1 s.e.m.) vs incline, 0.6\u00ac\u00b14.5%; PL: level, 0.1\u00ac\u00b11.0% vs incline, 0.4\u00ac\u00b11.6%] and muscle work (LG: level, -8.4\u00ac\u00b18.4 J kg-1 muscle vs incline, -6.8\u00ac\u00b17.5 J kg-1 muscle; PL: level, -2.0\u00ac\u00b10.6 J kg-1 muscle vs incline, -1.4\u00ac\u00b10.7 J kg-1 muscle). Consequently, neither muscle significantly altered its contractile dynamics to do more work during incline hopping. Whereas electromyographic (EMG) phase, duration and intensity did not differ for the LG, the PL exhibited shorter but more intense periods of activation, together with reduced EMG phase (P<0.01), during incline versus level hopping. Our results indicate that design for spring-like tendon energy savings and economical muscle force generation is key for these two distal muscle-tendon units of the tammar wallaby, and the need to accommodate changes in work associated with level versus incline locomotion is achieved by more proximal muscles of the limb.\",TRUE\nDynamics of leg muscle function in tammar wallabies (M. eugenii) during level versus incline hopping,\"The goal of our study was to examine whether the in vivo force-length behavior, work and elastic energy savings of distal muscle-tendon units in the legs of tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) change during level versus incline hopping.
