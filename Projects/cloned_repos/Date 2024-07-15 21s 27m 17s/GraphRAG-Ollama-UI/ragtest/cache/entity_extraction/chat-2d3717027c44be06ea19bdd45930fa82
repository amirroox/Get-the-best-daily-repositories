Due to the extreme speeds of these strikes underwater, cavitation occurs between their appendages and hard-shelled prey. Here we examine the magnitude and relative contribution of the impact and cavitation forces generated by the peacock mantis shrimp Odontodactylus scyllarus. We present the surprising finding that each strike generates two brief, high-amplitude force peaks, typically 390\u201a\u00c4\u00ec480 \u0152\u00bas apart. Based on high-speed imaging, force measurements and acoustic analyses, it is evident that the first force peak is caused by the limb's impact and the second force peak is due to the collapse of cavitation bubbles. Peak limb impact forces range from 400 to 1501 N and peak cavitation forces reach 504 N. Despite their small size, O. scyllarus can generate impact forces thousands of times their body weight. Furthermore, on average, cavitation peak forces are 50% of the limb's impact force, although cavitation forces may exceed the limb impact forces by up to 280%. The rapid succession of high peak forces used by mantis shrimp suggests that mantis shrimp use a potent combination of cavitation forces and extraordinarily high impact forces to fracture shells. The stomatopod's hammer is fundamentally different from typical shell-crushing mechanisms such as fish jaws and lobster claws, and may have played an important and as yet unexamined role in the evolution of shell form.\",TRUE\nExtreme resistance of bdelloid rotifers to ionizing radiation,\"Rotifers of class Bdelloidea are common invertebrate animals with highly unusual characteristics, including apparently obligate asexuality, the ability to resume reproduction after desiccation at any life stage, and a paucity of transposable genetic elements of types not prone to horizontal transmission. We find that bdelloids are also extraordinarily resistant to ionizing radiation (IR). Reproduction of the bdelloids Adineta vaga and Philodina roseola is much more resistant to IR than that of Euchlanis dilatata, a rotifer belonging to the desiccation-intolerant and facultatively sexual class Monogononta, and all other animals for which we have found relevant data. By analogy with the desiccation- and radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans, we suggest that the extraordinary radiation resistance of bdelloid rotifers is a consequence of their evolutionary adaptation to survive episodes of desiccation encountered in their characteristic habitats and that the damage incurred in such episodes includes DNA breakage that is repaired upon rehydration. Such breakage and repair may have maintained bdelloid chromosomes as colinear pairs and kept the load of transposable genetic elements low and may also have contributed to the success of bdelloid rotifers in avoiding the early extinction suffered by most asexuals.\",TRUE\nFast and Facile Biodegradation of Polystyrene by the Gut Microbial Flora of Plesiophthalmus davidis Larvae,\"PS is widely produced in the modern world, but it is robust against biodegradation. A few studies reported the biodegradation of PS, but most of them merely observed its weight loss; fewer were able to find its chemical modifications, which are rather direct evidence of biodegradation, by using limited organisms. Therefore, it is required to find an effective way to decompose PS using various kinds of organisms. Herein, we discovered a new PS-degrading insect species and bacterial strain, and we found that the genus that includes the PS-degrading bacterial strain occurs in significant amounts in the larval gut flora, and the proportion of this genus increased as the larvae were fed Styrofoam. Our research offers a wider selection of PS-degrading insects and the possibility of using a certain mixture of bacteria that resemble the gut flora of a PS-degrading insect to biodegrade PS, and thus could contribute to solving the global plastic crisis. ABSTRACT Polystyrene (PS), which accounts for a significant fraction of plastic wastes, is difficult to biodegrade due to its unique molecular structure. Therefore, biodegradation and chemical modification of PS are limited. In this study, we report PS biodegradation by the larvae of the darkling beetle Plesiophthalmus davidis (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). In 14\u201a\u00c4\u00e2days, P. davidis ingested 34.27\u201a\u00c4\u00e2\u00ac\u00b1\u201a\u00c4\u00e24.04\u201a\u00c4\u00e2mg of Styrofoam (PS foam) per larva and survived by feeding only on Styrofoam. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that the ingested Styrofoam was oxidized. Gel permeation chromatography analysis indicated the decrease in average molecular weight of the residual PS in the frass compared with the feed Styrofoam.
