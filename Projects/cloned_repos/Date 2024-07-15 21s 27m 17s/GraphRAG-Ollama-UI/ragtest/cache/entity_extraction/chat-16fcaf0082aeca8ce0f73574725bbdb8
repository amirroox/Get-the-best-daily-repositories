{"result": " Title: Design and Biomimicry: A Systematic Review of Interconnections and Creative Potentials\n\nAuthors: S\u00e1, A.A.M.d.; Viana, D.M.\n\nJournal: Biomimetics\n\nYear: 2023\n\nSummary: This study systematically reviews the interdisciplinary connections between design and biomimicry, highlighting their creative potentials. The review was conducted using the Theory of Consolidated Meta-Analytical Approach, with a search on Web of Science for publications from 1991 to 2021 using the descriptors \"design\" and \"biomimicry\". A total of 196 publications were retrieved, which were organized according to areas of knowledge, countries, journals, institutions, authors, and years. Citation, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling analyses were also performed.\n\nThe research emphasized the conception of products, buildings, and environments; the exploration of natural structures and systems to create materials and technologies; the use of biomimetic creative tools in product design; and projects focused on saving resources and implementing sustainability. The authors noted a tendency for problem-based approaches in the study of biomimicry.\n\nThe study concluded that the study of biomimicry can stimulate the development of multiple skills in design, improving creativity, and enhancing the potential integration of sustainability into production cycles. Keywords associated with this research include \"design\", \"biomimicry\", \"biomimetic design\", \"systematic review\", \"bio-inspiration\", \"bionics\", \"bio-inspired design\", \"nature-inspired design\", \"bio-informed design\", and \"sustainability\".\n\nThis article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Thus, a systematic review was undertaken to identify, describe, and analyze the contributions of biomimicry to design. For this purpose, the integrative systematic review model, called the Theory of Consolidated Meta-Analytical Approach, was used, carrying out a search on the Web of Science with the descriptors \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201cbiomimicry\u201d. For the period from 1991 to 2021, 196 publications were retrieved. The results were organized according to areas of knowledge, countries, journals, institutions, authors, and years. Citation, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling analyses were also performed. The investigation highlighted the following research emphases: the conception of products, buildings, and environments; the exploration of natural structures and systems to create materials and technologies; the use of biomimetic creative tools in product design; and projects focused on saving resources and implementing sustainability. It was noted that there was a tendency for authors to adopt a problem-based approach. It was concluded that the study of biomimicry can stimulate the development of multiple skills in design, improving creativity, and enhancing the potential integration of sustainability into production cycles.\n\nKeywords: design; biomimicry; biomimetic design; systematic review; bio-inspiration; bionics; bio-inspired design; nature-inspired design; bio-informed design; sustainability Citation: S\u00e1, A.A.M.d.; Viana, D.M.\n\nDesign and Biomimicry: A Review of\n\nInterconnections and Creative\n\n1.
