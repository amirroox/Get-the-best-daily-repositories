Tree frog toe pads have a gradient of stiffness, with the outer layer being softest (effective elastic modulus 4-25 kPa) and the deeper structures having unknown physical properties. The stiffness gradient is due to a dense network of capillaries beneath the pad epidermis that probably has a shock absorbing function.\n\n2.

The mormyrid fish Brienomyrus brachyistius has been successfully bred in the laboratory through simulating artificial rain conditions.

The principal muscles there have short fibres, and most of the storage must be in tendons. Investigation of camels shows that tendons in the feet, distal to the ankle and wrist, are especially important. The scope for elastic storage while the feet are off the groundis also considered.Though the evidence presented in this paper comes mainly from a few species, the conclusions presumably apply to large mammals in general.\",TRUE\nElastic modulus of tree frog adhesive toe pads,\"Previous work using an atomic force microscope in nanoindenter mode indicated that the outer, 10- to 15-\u0152\u00bam thick, keratinised layer of tree frog toe pads has a modulus of elasticity equivalent to silicone rubber (5\u201a\u00c4\u00ec15\u00ac\u2020MPa) (Scholz et al. 2009), but gave no information on the physical properties of deeper structures. In this study, micro-indentation is used to measure the stiffness of whole toe pads of the tree frog, Litoria caerulea. We show here that tree frog toe pads are amongst the softest of biological structures (effective elastic modulus 4\u201a\u00c4\u00ec25\u00ac\u2020kPa), and that they exhibit a gradient of stiffness, being stiffest on the outside. This stiffness gradient results from the presence of a dense network of capillaries lying beneath the pad epidermis, which probably has a shock absorbing function. Additionally, we compare the physical properties (elastic modulus, work of adhesion, pull-off force) of the toe pads of immature and adult frogs.\",TRUE\nElasticity of the hair cover in air-retaining Salvinia surfaces,\"Immersed in water superhydrophobic surfaces (e.g., lotus) maintain thin temporary air films. In certain aquatic plants and animals, these films are thicker and more persistent. Floating ferns of the genus Salvinia show elaborated hierarchical superhydrophobic surface structures: a hairy cover of complex trichomes. In the case of S. molesta, they are eggbeater shaped and topped by hydrophilic tips, which pin the air\u201a\u00c4\u00ecwater interface and prevent rupture of contact. It has been proposed that these trichomes can oscillate with the air\u201a\u00c4\u00ecwater interface, when turbulences occur and thereby stabilize the air film. The deformability of such arrays of trichomes requires a certain elasticity of the structures. In this study, we determined the stiffness of the trichome coverage of S. molesta and three other Salvinia species. Our results confirm the elasticity of the trichome coverage in all investigated Salvinia species. We did not reveal a clear relationship between the time of air retention and stiffness of the trichome coverage, which means that the air retention function is additionally dependent on different parameters, e.g., the trichome shape and surface free energy. These data are not only interesting for Salvinia biology, but also important for the development of biomimetic air-retaining surfaces.\",TRUE\nElectrical and behavioral courtship displays in the mormyrid fish Brienomyrus brachyistius,\"SUMMARY Mormyrid electric fish rely on the waveform of their electric organ discharges (EODs) for communicating species, sex, and social status, while they use the sequences of pulse intervals (SPIs) for communicating rapidly changing behavioral states and motivation. Little is known of electric signaling during courtship behavior because of two major difficulties: (1) the fish are not easily bred in captivity and (2) there is no reliable means of separating electric signals from several individuals in natural communication settings. Through simulating artificial rain conditions, we have successfully induced courtship and succeeded in breeding a mormyrid electric fish (Brienomyrus brachyistius) in the laboratory. We have also developed a system of video recording and editing combined with cross correlation analysis to precisely record and view behavior and separate EODs from two individuals in non-breeding and breeding contexts. Knowing the electrical and motor patterns during courtship allows for further exploration of topics such as mate choice and neural basis of pattern generation in these fish. Here we describe nine common motor displays and 11 SPIs. Analysis of frequency of occurrences suggests that some SPI patterns are sex and season specific. We also observed electrical duetting called `rasp matching' during courtship signaling among pairs; males and females exchange `rasps' and `bursts', respectively, in alternation. Our study employs new techniques to separate and document SPIs in the context of courtship. We show that some SPIs correlate with specific behavioral acts around the time of spawning.\",TRUE\nElectrical signals control wound healing through phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-\u0152\u2265 and PTEN,\"Wound healing is essential for maintaining the integrity of multicellular organisms.
