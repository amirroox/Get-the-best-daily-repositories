{"result": " The article discusses the African crested rat (Lophiomys imhausi) and its unique ability to acquire, disperse, and advertise a potentially lethal toxin from the plant Acokanthera schimperi. This behavior is known as \"unpalatability by appropriation\" and is common among invertebrates but has not been reported before in placental mammals.\n\nThe African crested rat uses complex morphological structures and behaviors to sequester this toxin. The toxin is advertised through aposematic displays, which serve as a deterrent to potential predators. The specific details of the structures and behaviors involved in this process are not provided in the given text, but it is suggested that they play a crucial role in the rat's survival.\n\nThe study highlights an interesting adaptation in the African crested rat, demonstrating the diversity and complexity of strategies animals can employ to protect themselves from predators. Further research on this topic could provide valuable insights into the evolution and ecology of toxicity in mammals.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

Extensive studies on the dermis revealed that it can adopt three different states having different mechanical properties that can be reversibly converted. These are the stiff, standard and soft states. The standard state is readily produced when a dermal piece is immersed in the sea water containing Ca2+, whereas the soft state can be produced by removal of Ca2+. A stiffening protein, tensilin, has been isolated from some sea cucumbers (Cucumaria frondosa and Holothuria leucospilota). Although tensilin converts the state of the dermis from soft to standard, it cannot convert from standard to stiff. In this study, we isolated and partially purified a novel stiffening factor from the dermis of Holothuria leucospilota. The factor stiffened the dermis in normal artificial sea water (ASW) but did not stiffen the soft dermis in Ca2+-free ASW. It also stiffened the dermis that had been converted to the standard state in Ca2+-free ASW by the action of tensilin. These results suggest that the factor produces the stiff dermis from the standard state but cannot work as a stiffener on the soft dermis. Its addition to longitudinal muscles of the sea cucumber produced no effects, suggesting that its effect is specific to the catch connective tissue. Its stiffening activity was susceptible to trypsin, meaning that it is a polypeptide, and its molecular mass estimated from gel filtration chromatography was 2.4 kDa.\",TRUE\nA Passionate Free Climber: Structural Development and Functional Morphology of the Adhesive Tendrils in Passiflora discophora,\"Premise of research.\u201a\u00c4\u00c9Passiflora discophora is exceptional among passion flowers for its climbing strategy, using branched tendrils with terminal adhesive pads instead of coiling tendrils as typical within this family. This article investigates the structural development and morphology of these adhesive pads and aims to understand the underlying structure-function relationship of the attachment process. Based on our results, we discuss possible mechanical consequences of the tendril structure and compare our findings with similar attachment systems in unrelated species in order to identify general strategies of this mode of attachment. Methodology.\u201a\u00c4\u00c9We investigated the temporal development of the attachment process, including detailed studies of the morphology and anatomy of the adhesive pads, using LM with different staining procedures and SEM. Pivotal results.\u201a\u00c4\u00c9Young tendrils establish initial contact with a supporting substrate by interlocking with their hook-shaped tips. Touch stimuli induce the tips to develop into adhesive pads by callus-like growth of papillate epidermal cells. Fully grown pads are hemispherical on flat substrates or completely fill out larger cavities of the substrate. By apical cell division, the pad tissue perfectly mimics the microtopography of the substrate and also grows into minute gaps and fissures, establishing firm anchorage by optimal form closure. Additionally, an extracellular substance is visible at the interface between pad and substrate surface, which might act as adhesive. Conclusions.\u201a\u00c4\u00c9The opportunistic growth and cellular structure make the tendrils and adhesive pads of P. discophora a highly adaptive attachment system. Comparison with other not closely related taxa reveals general principles of this climbing mode, namely, (1) branched tendrils with multiple adhesive pads, (2) papillate cells establishing optimal form closure with the substrate and in some species additionally secreting adhesive substances, (3) free coiling of axes, and (4) persisting anchorage after senescence.\",TRUE\nA poisonous surprise under the coat of the African crested rat,\"Plant toxins are sequestered by many animals and the toxicity is frequently advertised by aposematic displays to deter potential predators.
