The authors analyzed the ability of these elements to function as a protective layer responsive to climatic variations. They proposed a design process to guide the construction of kinetic fa\u00e7ades from a morphological and interdisciplinary approach, in which biomimetic characteristics are combined with parametric and energy efficiency technologies.\n\nTate et al. [42] studied the interaction between biomimicry and the circular economy based on ecosystem analogies. They called attention to the flows of energy and matter in nature, primarily based on recycling and reuse between the different trophic levels.\n\nTate et al. exemplified their concepts by reviewing relationships of mutualism found in nature. In the authors\u2019 opinion, the insertion of biomimetic knowledge and principles into new economic and business approaches can promote innovation in the organizational sphere. In fact, this work contributed to the recognition of biomimicry as an area from which knowledge can be useful in the strategic, administrative, and organizational plans of companies.\n\nXing et al. [43] combined the study of plants, more specifically plant cells, with the development of fa\u00e7ade design and technologies for building cladding, resulting in a con-\n\n\n\n\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n11 of 16\n\nceptual proposal for a biodome, with improvements in thermal insulation and energy efficiency. The authors prioritized the study of plant-based analogies to generate constructive proposals, due to the sessile character of plants, which requires them to adapt to the surrounding conditions (as they fixed in a single location, a characteristic also associated with buildings). Xing et al. generated a framework for the design process of biomimetic projects.\n\nAmer [44] incorporated biomimetic notions into the syllabus of a university course, covering the following topics: interrelationships between biomimicry and building design; project methodology; natural lighting management; and plant-inspired fa\u00e7ades; as well as research activities, design, parametric digital prototyping (with Rhinoceros and Grasshopper software), and the use of the biomimetic design concept generation matrix.\n\nAccording to the author, the students realized the importance of the responsibility inherent in professional practice regarding the preservation of the health of human communities and those of other species.\n\nAdditionally, in Figure 4, two more nuclei can be observed, with the works of Clark [45]\n\nand Zari [46]. The first publication researched marine biomineralization for monitoring and forecasting the impacts of climate change and for the design of new biocomposite materials [45]. In the second publication, Zari [46] endeavored to analyze how the urban environment can insert new proposals into its design that incorporate ecosystem services committed to the regeneration of biodiversity and the resilience of natural environments faced with climate change.\n\nIn summary, an examination of the results from the coupling analysis allowed verifica-tion that the themes of recent research in biomimicry and design include, on one hand, the investigation of the physicochemical properties of materials and microstructures, mainly biological structures of reptiles and marine animals. On the other hand, there is a focus on the design of components, coatings, and finishes for application in architecture, including bioclimatic factors (e.g., local context, energy, and resource savings) and environmental responsiveness. This enables envisaging the creation of adaptable buildings that operate similarly to living organisms. In this scope, the authors mainly investigated plant elements as a source of inspiration. Among the highlighted works, there were also many proposals for creative tools, frameworks, and parametric software that aim to assist in the search for biological solutions and the transfer of such natural characteristics to the conceptual development in design. Another research emphasis focused on sustainability, including aspects of ecosystems and interspecific ecological relationships that demonstrate the potential to inspire a multiplicity of projects, such as the design of products and even strategic design. In addition, in the present study, there were research perspectives that addressed, respectively, the importance of supporting ecosystem services in the urban environment and the development of materials such as biocomposites.\n\nGiven what is presented above, it is possible to infer that the coupling analysis highlighted initiatives in biomimetic design that demonstrate a remarkable capacity to generate innovations to solve emerging challenges in several fields of human activity. Finally, it should be stressed that, once again, the authors highlighted in the densest cluster produced research and projects guided by the problem-based approach.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe results of this systematic review allowed establishing connections and making conjectures about the scenarios of publications indexed by the Web of Science. It is be-lieved that the panorama of productions showcased in the present research encompasses contributions that may assist researchers and designers in their endeavors, as the main themes and emphases\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
