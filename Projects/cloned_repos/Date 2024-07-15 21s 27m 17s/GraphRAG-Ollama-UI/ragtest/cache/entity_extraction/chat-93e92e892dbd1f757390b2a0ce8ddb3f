{"result": " The northern flying squirrel and the black-tailed prairie dog both utilize biological strategies that can inspire technological innovations.\n\n1. Northern Flying Squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus): This mammal is known for its ability to glide between trees. Understanding the aerodynamics of its glide could potentially improve parachute and skydiving non-equilibrium glides, as well as airplane aeronautics. This could help increase efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in planes that currently burn fossil fuels, or in the future, electric planes that need maximum efficiency to help batteries last as long as possible.\n\n2. Black-tailed Prairie Dog (Cynomys ludovicianus): These rodents build extensive underground burrows and use differences in position and shape of burrow openings to create passive ventilation from wind energy by altering air pressure. The varied height and distribution of the burrow openings help harness wind energy from the windy plains, creating one-way air flow through the burrow as air rushes out the higher opening and is drawn in to the lower opening. This strategy could inspire designs for passive ventilation systems that utilize wind energy effectively.\n\nThese biological strategies demonstrate nature's ability to solve complex problems with elegant solutions, offering valuable insights for technological innovation.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

Now instead of it both falling downward and gliding forward it\u2019s just moving horizontally forward.\n\nIn the final phase, the squirrel\u2019s body position is nearly vertical. Lift increases significantly, and the net aerodynamic force continues to rotate rearward, slowing the squirrel enough so it can land.
