{"result": " Title: Biomimetic Design in the Interdisciplinary Field of Design: A Systematic Review\n\nAbstract: This study aims to systematically review the literature on biomimetic design, focusing on its applications and implications for the interdisciplinary field of design. The investigation was conducted using Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, EBSCO, and ProQuest databases due to their extensive temporal coverage and frequent updates. Additionally, other software and platforms such as MAXQDA, CiteSpace, Publish or Perish, San-keyMATIc, Bibexcel, Gephi, Pajek, Ucinet, and Science of Science (Sci2) were considered for future surveys. The use of the descriptors biomimicry and design was sufficient to achieve the objectives proposed in this research; however, it is suggested that more terms such as bioinspiration, biometrics, bionics, biodesign, biomimetic design, bioinspired design, bionic design, nature-based design, nature-inspired design, biologically-inspired design, and bio-informed design be incorporated in future surveys to cover a greater number of works. The results indicate that adopting interdisciplinary knowledge in the field of design is essential for expanding creative perspectives and diversifying theories, approaches, and resources. Biomimicry has shown great potential for projects in design, and it is necessary to develop genuinely biomimetic designs that effectively integrate the concepts, principles, and creative tools of biomimicry throughout the entire creative process of products and services.\n\nKeywords: Biomimetic Design; Interdisciplinary Knowledge; Creative Perspectives; Sustainable Factors; Ecological Factors; Nature-Based Design; Bioinspiration; Bionics; Biodesign; Biomimetics; Bionic Design; Nature-Inspired Design; Biologically-Inspired Design; Bio-Informed Design\n\nIntroduction:\nThe interdisciplinary field of design is a plural and interdisciplinary area that seeks to enable creations for various human endeavors.

The study of aspects of biomimicry in design can enhance the development of multiple skills, such as creative and conceptual generation, observation and research, study of materials, graphic expression, and three-dimensional conception and digital modeling.\n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.A.M.d.S.; methodology, A.A.M.d.S. and D.M.V.; software, A.A.M.d.S.; validation, A.A.M.d.S. and D.M.V.; formal analysis, A.A.M.d.S.; investigation A.A.M.d.S.; resources A.A.M.d.S.; data curation, A.A.M.d.S.; writing\u2014original draft, A.A.M.d.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, D.M.V.; visualization, A.A.M.d.S.; supervision, D.M.V.\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\nConflict of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

However, like any procedure for surveying and analyzing the literature, it is crucial to understand that, from the moment specifications are established for the research themes, descriptors, software, databases, and filters that will be used, it is inevitable that certain works will not be captured by the selected criteria, which can limit the scope of the contributions of a review such as the present work.\n\nThe chosen database for this research (Web of Science) is one of the main multidisci-plinary repositories, having an excellent temporal coverage of publications, in addition to ensuring a frequent update of indexed works, including complementary materials such as conference proceedings [19]. Nevertheless, the Web of Science mainly covers content published in English and, as discussed earlier, there is no specific filtering function for the field of design. Thus, the investigation of other multilingual repositories, such as Scopus, Google Scholar, EBSCO, ProQuest [19, 47] is recommended. Furthermore, when analyzing other systematic reviews, it is noticeable that other software and platforms, in addition to those employed in the present review, have been used by authors to organize and facilitate data processing. Some examples are: MAXQDA, CiteSpace, Publish or Perish, San-keyMATIc, Bibexcel, Gephi, Pajek, Ucinet, and Science of Science (Sci2) [47\u201349].\n\nThe adoption of the descriptors biomimicry and design was sufficient to achieve the objectives proposed in the scope of this research. However, considering that only two descriptors were used, it is suggested that more terms be incorporated in future surveys, such as: bioinspiration, biomimetics, bionics, biodesign, biomimetic design, bioinspired design, bionic design, nature-based design, nature-inspired design, biologically-inspired design, and bio-informed design. Thus, it will be possible to cover an even greater number of works, which may lead to relevant developments for the scientific and professional communities.\n\nIn summary, with this review, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of adopting interdisciplinary knowledge in the field of design to expand the creative perspectives of professionals and to diversify theories, approaches, and resources. In this sense, biomimicry has shown itself to be an area of great potential for projects in design. In this work, the expression \u201cbiomimetic design\u201d was generically adopted when analyzing publications from the intersection between the design and biomimicry domains. However, it is necessary to understand that further efforts are needed in favor of more \u2018genuinely\u2019 biomimetic designs, developed in the specific field of design, in which, throughout the entire creative process of products and services, the concepts, principles, and creative tools of biomimicry are effectively integrated.\n\nUnlike technologies that require specific procedures, authorizations, investments, and monetization for access, nature is an extensive (and more accessible) repository of resources that can be investigated and interpreted by human beings, which can complement and expand current practices in design. Furthermore, as evidenced by several authors, the field of design is plural and interdisciplinary, as it seeks to enable creations for different areas of human endeavor [1\u20134, 50\u201355]. Including the perspective of biomimicry in teaching and professional practice scenarios in design can expand creative horizons, allowing the creation of innovative solutions that are more efficient, economical, and better adapted to consumer needs and environmental diversity [6, 55,56].\n\nFinally, as the study of aspects of biomimicry in design can enhance the development of multiple skills (such as creative and conceptual generation, observation and research, study of materials, graphic expression, and three-dimensional conception and digital modeling), it is important to recognize that understanding nature and knowing how to explore its resources are indispensable requirements for contemporary professional training, since they can encourage creativity as well as the integration of ecological and sustainable factors in production cycles.\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n14 of 16\n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.A.M.d.S.; methodology, A.A.M.d.S. and D.M.V.; software, A.A.M.d.S.; validation, A.A.M.d.S. and D.M.V.; formal analysis, A.A.M.d.S.; investigation A.A.M.d.S.; resources A.A.M.d.S.; data curation, A.A.M.d.S.; writing\u2014original draft, A.A.M.d.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.A.M.d.S. and D.M.V.; visualization, A.A.M.d.S.; supervision, D.M.V.\n\nAll authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\n\nFunding:\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
