The stiffness of sea cucumber dermis is regulated by cell-mediated secretion of either a stiffening or plasticizing protein, and alterations in dermis stiffness brought about by manipulation of Ca(2+) levels are mediated by effects on secretion of one or both of these proteins.\n\n2. The high water permeability characteristic of mammalian red cell membranes is caused by the protein AQP1, which freely permits movement of water across the cell membrane but not other small, uncharged molecules or charged solutes. AQP1 is a tetramer with each subunit containing an aqueous pore likened to an hourglass formed by obversely arranged tandem repeats.\n\n3.

Cercosporamide inhibits bone morphogenetic protein receptor type I kinase activity in zebrafish, causing developmental defects similar to those caused by small-molecule BMPR type I kinase inhibitors and inactivating mutations in zebrafish BMPRs. In mammalian cell-based assays, cercosporamide blocked BMP/SMAD-dependent transcriptional reporter activity and BMP-induced SMAD1/5-phosphorylation.

Previous experiments with Cucumaria frondosa have established that these Ca(2+) effects are due to Ca(2+)-dependent cellular processes rather than to direct effects of Ca(2+) on the extracellular matrix. The present report describes two protein factors that are released from cells of C. frondosa dermis by membrane lysis and that directly alter the stiffness of the extracellular matrix. One factor, isolated from the inner dermis, increased tissue stiffness in the absence of Ca(2+). The second factor, from the outer dermis, decreased tissue stiffness in the presence of normal Ca(2+) levels. The relative abundance of these two factors in the inner and outer dermis suggests the possibility that the cells that control tissue stiffness are spatially segregated. Both factors were partially purified under non-denaturing conditions by anion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. The partially purified protein preparations retained biological activity. These results suggest that the stiffness of sea cucumber dermis is regulated by cell-mediated secretion of either the stiffening or plasticizing protein and that alterations in dermis stiffness brought about by manipulation of Ca(2+) levels are mediated by effects on secretion of one or both of these proteins.\",TRUE\nCellular and Molecular Biology of the Aquaporin Water Channels,\"The high water permeability characteristic of mammalian red cell membranes is now known to be caused by the protein AQP1. This channel freely permits movement of water across the cell membrane, but it is not permeated by other small, uncharged molecules or charged solutes. AQP1 is a tetramer with each subunit containing an aqueous pore likened to an hourglass formed by obversely arranged tandem repeats. Cryoelectron microscopy of reconstituted AQP1 membrane crystals has revealed the three-dimensional structure at 3\u201a\u00c4\u00ec6 \u221a\u00d6. AQP1 is distributed in apical and basolateral membranes of renal proximal tubules and descending thin limbs as well as capillary endothelia. Ten mammalian aquaporins have been identified in water-permeable tissues and fall into two groupings. Orthodox aquaporins are water-selective and include AQP2, a vasopressin-regulated water channel in renal collecting duct, in addition to AQP0, AQP4, and AQP5. Multifunctional aquaglyceroporins AQP3, AQP7, and AQP9 are permeated by water, glycerol, and some other solutes. Aquaporins are being defined in numerous other species including amphibia, insects, plants, and microbials. Members of the aquaporin family are implicated in numerous physiological processes as well as the pathophysiology of a wide range of clinical disorders.\",TRUE\nCellulose synthase interactive1- and microtubule-dependent cell wall architecture is required for acid growth in Arabidopsis hypocotyls,We observed a correlation between acid growth and crossed-polylamellate cell walls which was dependent on CSI1 and microtubules.

Here, we identified cercosporamide, a metabolite from the fungus Ascochyta aquiliqiae, as a potent bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR) type I kinase inhibitor through a zebrafish embryo phenotypic screen. The developmental defects in zebrafish, including lack of the ventral fin, induced by cercosporamide were strikingly similar to the phenotypes caused by renowned small-molecule BMPR type I kinase inhibitors and inactivating mutations in zebrafish BMPRs. In mammalian cell-based assays, cercosporamide blocked BMP/SMAD-dependent transcriptional reporter activity and BMP-induced SMAD1/5-phosphorylation. Biochemical assays with a panel of purified recombinant kinases demonstrated that cercosporamide directly inhibited kinase activity of type I BMPRs [also called activin receptor-like kinases (ALKs)]. In mammalian cells, cercosporamide selectively inhibited constitutively active BMPR type I-induced SMAD\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
