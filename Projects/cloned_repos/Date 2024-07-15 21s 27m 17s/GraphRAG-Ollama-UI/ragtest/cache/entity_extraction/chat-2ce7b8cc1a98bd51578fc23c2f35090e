{"result": " The analysis of the co-citation map shows that the main focus of publications on biomimicry between 1991 and 2021 is centered around the work of Janine Benyus, which played a significant role in disseminating knowledge about biomimicry. The central area of the map contains nuclei related to the development of biomimetic design works that demonstrate the application of biomimicry principles.\n\nThe analysis also revealed clusters of publications that focus on technical aspects, including development stages and processes of biomimetic design. These works often present tools, models, approaches, or processes, and guidelines for projects. Some of these works are directed toward researching and analyzing natural and artificial systems.\n\nSmaller nuclei in the map discuss issues related to circularity and sustainability, which are often linked to biomimicry-based design. A predominant approach found in the works of multiple authors is the problem-based biomimetic approach, which begins with a design challenge and the functional requirements of a project. Only after this initial step do biological aspects relevant to each context become investigated.\n\nAfter performing the co-citation analysis, a word cloud was generated, composed of the fifty most frequent words from the set of works published in the period from 1991 to 2021 (n = 196). The word cloud provides an overview of the main themes and topics discussed in these publications.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

Thus, their proposal is very relevant to the field of biomimetic product design and the systematization of idea generation.\n\nOther publications, shown in Figure 1, are also worth mentioning. Located in the lower left part of the co-citation map, is the Biomimicry Resource Handbook manual by Baumeister et al. [38], which provides the essentials of biomimicry, including guidelines for applying biomimetic methods, approaches, and tools to conduct creative projects (e.g., Biomimicry Thinking Design Lens, Challenge to Biology and Biology to Design approaches, Biomimicry Taxonomy Chart, Life\u2019s Principles Diagram).\n\nAnother interesting work found on the map is Cradle to Cradle by Braungart and McDonough [39], which is positioned in the upper left portion of the map. This publication proposes reinventing the life cycle of products and processes. In their work, the authors emphasized the integration of design and science to favor lasting social benefits, stimulating the regeneration of the natural realm and the improvement of human quality of life.\n\nThey also advocated the use of safe materials, water, and energy in the context of the circular economy, eliminating the concepts of waste and disposal. Therefore, according to Braungart and McDonough, design can be reconfigured with a view to effectively having a positive impact.\n\nIn view of what was previously presented, through the analysis of the co-citation map, it became possible to verify the thematic emphases of publications in the period between 1991 and 2021. As expected, the main nucleus was concentrated around the work of Benyus, which was a crucial work in the dissemination of knowledge about biomimicry. In addition, it was found that, the central area of the map contained nuclei related to the development of biomimetic design works in which the authors present field theories and project cases that exemplify the use of biomimicry principles. It is interesting to mention that, on the map, there was also a highlight on clusters whose publications evidenced specifications of technical aspects, including development stages and processes of biomimetic design.\n\nThis was carried out through the presentation of tools, models, approaches or processes, and guidelines for projects. Some of the works of this group are directed toward the research and functional analysis of natural and artificial systems.
