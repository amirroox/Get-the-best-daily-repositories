{"result": " In the bibliographic coupling map from 2018 to 2021, a high concentration is observed in the nucleus, which includes the publication by Perera and Coppens [40]. The authors investigated new design possibilities through the lens of bioinspired materials and chemical engineering. Some of the presented materials were based on the structure of mother-of-pearl; on strong, reusable adhesives that mimic gecko toe-pads; and on antibacterial surfaces based on shark skin. Perera and Coppens emphasized that seeking inspiration in natural patterns provides an opportunity for redesigning materials, which may result in creations that even without directly resembling the mimicked organism, will have an inherent link with nature in their properties and functionality.\n\nIn the center of the map, groups are clustered by Hosseini et al.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.
