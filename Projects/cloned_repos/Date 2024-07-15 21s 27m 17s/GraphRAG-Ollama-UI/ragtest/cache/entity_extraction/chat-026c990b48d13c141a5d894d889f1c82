{"result": " The text you provided discusses two biological strategies found in birds and flying squirrels that help them save energy during flight or gliding, respectively.\n\n1. Birds flying just above the water: When birds fly close to the water's surface, they experience less downwash and vortex formation due to limited space. This results in a higher pressure cushion beneath their wings, increasing lift, and decreased drag, reducing the energy required to stay airborne. This strategy could potentially be applied to airplanes and drones to improve fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n2. Flying squirrels controlling their glide: Flying squirrels have membranes and cartilage that help them alter lift and drag forces, enabling them to glide more than 100 times their body length. They do not glide under equilibrium but continuously change their velocities during three phases of \"flight.\" The first phase is a ballistic dive, where the squirrel leaps from a high tree branch, gains forward momentum, and accelerates due to gravity. The second phase involves tilting the body upwards, rotating the net force from pointing forward to upward, and then towards the back, corresponding to an increase in acceleration. The third phase is the deceleration phase, where the squirrel's velocity decreases. These anatomical features help flying squirrels save energy during gliding, expand their foraging range, and potentially avoid predators.\n\nThese biological strategies demonstrate how studying nature can inspire innovations to improve efficiency in various fields, such as aviation and robotics.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

The appearance may be graceful, but the real grace is efficiency. These birds are using tricks of physics to catch a nearly free ride over the deep.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nPelicans, skimmers, and other birds save energy when gliding across water because of something called the\n\n\u201cground effect,\u201d which increases lift and reduces drag.\n\n\n\nWhen a bird glides, it stretches its wings outward and rides the wind, saving the energy it would otherwise Image: \u00a9Biomimicry Institute\n\nuse to flap. In this \u201cfixed-wing\u201d mode of flight, some of the air that flows under the wing impacts it and washes As a pelican nears the water surface, the downwash below downward, pushing the wing (and bird) upward. In the wing compresses the air and creates a cushion of addition, the curvature of the wing causes the air above higher\u2011pressure air (yellow arrows). This results in more lift (red arrows). The water also partially blocks the formation it to move faster and drop in pressure, also contributing of vortices, and decreases drag.\n\nto the lift. Near the tips of the wings, the higher-pressure air below is able to push up into the region of lower pressure above and create swirling vortices. Both downwash and the vortices increase drag, adding to the amount of energy required to stay airborne.\n\n\u00a92022 Biomimicry Institute\n\nBiomimicry.org | AskNature.org\n\n\n\n\n\nBIOLOGICAL STRATEGY\n\nWhen birds fly just above the water, the relative effects Visit this Strategy on AskNature:\n\nof these forces change.
