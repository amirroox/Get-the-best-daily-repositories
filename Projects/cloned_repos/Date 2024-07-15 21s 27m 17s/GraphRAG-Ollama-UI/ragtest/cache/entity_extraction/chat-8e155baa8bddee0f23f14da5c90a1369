Sutures oriented circumferentially are subject principally to compression. Those forming radial zig-zags are subject to compression near the apex and tension near the ambitus. Radial and circumferential sutures in Eucidaris are equally bound with collagen fibers but in Diadema, Tripneustes, Psammechinus, Arbacia and other regular echinoids, most radial sutures are more heavily bound, and thus stronger in tension. Psammechinus, Tripneustes and several other echinoids have radial sutures thickened by ribs which increase the area of interlocking trabeculae. Ribs also increase flexural stiffness and carry a greater proportion of the stress. Further, ribs effectively draw stress from weaker areas pierced by podial pores, and increase the total load which can be sustained.Allometry indicates that regular echinoids become relatively higher at the apex as size increases, thus reducing ambital stresses. Some spatangoids with very high domes (eg Agassizia) maintain isometry, but others (eg Meoma) become flatter with size. Both holectypoids (Echinoneus) and cassiduloids (Apatopygus) maintain a constant height to diameter relationship. Flattening, and consequently ambital tensile stress, is greatest in the clypeasteroids. In this group the formation of internal buttresses which preferentially carry stress, reaches maximum development. A notable exception, however, is the high domed Clypeaster rosaceus.In this analysis it was assumed that local buckling or bending does not occur. The test of some echinoids (e.g. Diadematoida) have relatively wide sutures swathed in collagen, which allows local deformation. Others (e.g. Arbacia) have rigid sutures with reduced collagen. In Psammechinus and other members of the Order Echinoida, in addition to rib formation, inner and outer surface trabeculae are thickened so that the individual plates are stiffened. Some spatangoids (Meoma, Paleopneustes) have extensive sutural collagen, but the cassiduloid Apatopygus has collagen confined to junctions of sutures, and elsewhere the joints are strengthened and stiffened by fusion of trabeculae. Fusion of surface trabeculae is almost complete in the holectypoid, Echinoneus, and the sutures are obscured.\",TRUE\nDragon fish see using chlorophyll,\"Most deep-sea fish have visual pigments that are most sensitive to wavelengths around 460-490 nm, the intensity maxima of both conventional blue bioluminescence and dim residual sunlight. The predatory deep-sea dragon fish Malacosteus niger, the closely related Aristostomias sp. and Pachystomias microdon can, in addition to blue bioluminescence, also emit far-red light from suborbital photophores, which is invisible to other deep-sea animals. Whereas Aristostomias sp. enhances its long-wavelength sensitivity using visual pigments that are unusually red sensitive, we now report that M. niger attains the same result using a derivative of chlorophyll as a photosensitizer.\",TRUE\n\"Dragonfly flight. II. Velocities, accelerations and kinematics of flapping flight.\",\"The free flapping flight of the dragonfly Sympetrum sanguineum and the damselfly Calopteryx splendens was filmed in a large flight enclosure at 3000 frames s-1. The wingtip kinematics are described for these flights. Despite the two species being similar in size, the damselfly flew with wingbeat frequencies half those of the dragonfly. The damselfly could perform a clap and fling, and the proximity to which the wings approached each other during this manoeuvre correlated with the total force produced during the wingstroke. The dragonfly beat its wings with a set inclination of the stroke planes with respect to the londitudinal body axis; the damselfly, in contrast, showed a greater variation in this angle. Both species aligned their stroke planes to be nearly normal to the direction of the resultant force, the thrust. In order to achieve this, the dragonfly body alignment correlated with the direction of thrust. However, the damselfly body alignment was independent of the thrust direction. Velocities and accelerations were greater for the dragonfly than for the damselfly. However, non-dimensional velocities and accelerations normalised by the wingbeat periods were greater for the damselfly.\",TRUE\nDragonfly wing nodus: A one-way hinge contributing to the asymmetric wing deformation.,\"Dragonfly wings are highly specialized locomotor systems, which are\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
