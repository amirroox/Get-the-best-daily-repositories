The second statement describes the circularly polarized light sensitivity of the Jewel Scarab Beetle Chrysina gloriosa. It shows that this beetle can detect circularly polarized light, which may allow it to perceive and communicate with conspecifics that remain cryptic to predators, reducing indirect costs of communication.

Genicula are formed when calcified cells decalcify and restructure to create flexible tissue. The present study has identified important differences in the main agaran disaccharidic repeating units [\u201a\u00dc\u00ed3)\u201a\u00c4\u00ea\u0152\u2264\u201a\u00c4\u00ead\u201a\u00c4\u00eaGalp (1\u201a\u00dc\u00ed 4)\u201a\u00c4\u00ea\u0152\u00b1\u201a\u00c4\u00eal\u201a\u00c4\u00eaGalp(1\u201a\u00dc\u00ed] synthesized by genicular and intergenicular segments. Based on chemical and spectroscopical analyses, we report that genicular cells from C. cheilosporioides biosynthesize a highly methoxylated galactan at C\u201a\u00c4\u00ea6 position with low levels of branching with xylose side stubs on C\u201a\u00c4\u00ea6 of the [\u201a\u00dc\u00ed3)\u201a\u00c4\u00ea\u0152\u2264\u201a\u00c4\u00ead\u201a\u00c4\u00eaGalp (1\u201a\u00dc\u00ed] units, whereas intergenicular segments produce xylogalactans with high levels of xylose and low levels of 6\u201a\u00c4\u00eaO\u201a\u00c4\u00eamethyl \u0152\u2264\u201a\u00c4\u00ead\u201a\u00c4\u00eaGal units.

We speculate that this structural shift is a consequence of a putative and specific methoxyl transferase that blocks the xylosylation on C\u201a\u00c4\u00ea6 of the 3\u201a\u00c4\u00ealinked \u0152\u2264\u201a\u00c4\u00ead\u201a\u00c4\u00eaGalp units. Changes in galactan substitutions may contribute to the distinct mechanical properties of genicula and may lend insight into the calcification process in coralline algae.\",TRUE\nDifferential Response to Circularly Polarized Light by the Jewel Scarab Beetle Chrysina gloriosa,\"Circularly polarized light is rare in the terrestrial environment, and cuticular reflections from scarab beetles are one of the few natural sources. Chrysina gloriosa LeConte 1854, a scarab beetle found in montane juniper forests of the extreme southwestern United States and northern Mexico, are camouflaged in juniper foliage; however, when viewed with right circularly polarizing filters, the beetles exhibit a stark black contrast. Given the polarization\u201a\u00c4\u00easpecific changes in the appearance of C. gloriosa, we hypothesized that C. gloriosa can detect circularly polarized light. We tested for phototactic response and differential flight orientation of C. gloriosa toward different light stimuli. Chrysina gloriosa exhibited (a) positive phototaxis, (b) differential flight orientation between linear and circularly polarized light stimuli of equal intensities, and (c) discrimination between circularly polarized and unpolarized lights of different intensities consistent with a model of circular polarization sensitivity based on a quarter\u201a\u00c4\u00eawave plate. These results demonstrate that C. gloriosa beetles respond differentially to circularly polarized light. In contrast, Chrysina woodi Horn 1885, a close relative with reduced circularly polarized reflection, exhibited no phototactic discrimination between linear and circularly polarized light. Circularly polarized sensitivity may allow C. gloriosa to perceive and communicate with conspecifics that remain cryptic to predators, reducing indirect costs of communication.\",TRUE\nDiffractive hygrochromic effect in the cuticle of the hercules beetle Dynastes hercules,\"The elytra from dry specimens of the hercules beetle, Dynastes hercules appear khaki-green in a dry atmosphere and turn black passively under high humidity levels. New scanning electron images, spectrophotometric measurements and physical modelling are used to unveil the mechanism of this colouration switch. The visible dry-state greenish colouration originates from a widely open porous layer located 3\u201a\u00c4\u00e2\u0152\u00bam below the cuticle surface. The structure of this layer is three-dimensional, with a network of filamentary strings, arranged in layers parallel to the cuticle surface and stiffening an array of strong cylindrical pillars oriented normal to the surface. Unexpectedly, diffraction plays a significant role in the broadband colouration of the cuticle in the dry state. The backscattering caused by this layer disappears when water infiltrates the structure\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
