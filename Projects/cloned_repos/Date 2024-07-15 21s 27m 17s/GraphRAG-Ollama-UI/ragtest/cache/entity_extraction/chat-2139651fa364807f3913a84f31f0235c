{"result": " It appears that you have conducted a literature review on biomimicry, focusing on works published between 1991 and 2021. You used co-citation analysis to identify the most common thematic approaches in the study of this topic and coupling analysis to highlight the main fronts of contemporary research.\n\nInitially, you found 633 documents, but after filtering out irrelevant categories such as agriculture, medicine, dentistry, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, materials science, electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, nanoscience, nanotechnology, pharmacy, and neurosciences, you were left with 196 documents.\n\nThe areas of knowledge with the highest number of contributions were:\n\n1. Engineering (n = 64)\n2. Science of Technology (n = 41)\n3. Environmental sciences and ecology (n = 31)\n4. Architecture (n = 24)\n\nIt's worth noting that the Web of Science does not have a specific category for filtering documents published exclusively in the domain of design, which impacts the investigation and means that works of interest in this field are obtained only in related areas.\n\nThe oldest work found on the Web of Science was an article by Li et al. (1995) exploring structural applications of synthetic composites and natural bamboo fibers. This pioneering study with a biomimetic approach is significant as it marks the beginning of research in this field, particularly from an engineering perspective.\n\nIn terms of visual analysis, you used platforms like VOSViewer and TagCrowd to generate images such as heat maps and network or line maps for word cloud analyses. This helped in understanding the interrelationships between the data obtained with the help of TEMAC and the content of the identified works.\n\nOverall, this literature review provides valuable insights into the evolution and current state of biomimicry research, particularly in the areas of engineering, science of technology, environmental sciences and ecology, and architecture.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

It should be noted that the first decade of this interval coincides with the publication of the work by Benyus, Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature, which contributed to the dissemination of the term \u201cbiomimicry\u201d [22].\n\nTo carry out the systematic review, the Theory of Consolidated Meta-Analytical Approach (TEMAC) integrative model was adopted. This resource recommends organizing the information collected in the database according to areas of knowledge, countries, journals, institutions, authors, and years. In addition, TEMAC guides the performance of citation, co-citation, coupling, co-occurrence, and word cloud analyses with the generation of images, such as heat maps and network or line maps. For this purpose, the VOSViewer and TagCrowd platforms were used [23].\n\nIt is worth clarifying that citation analysis is one of the means of measuring the impact of authors\u2019 production based on the number of citations listed in the database. Evidently, it is important not to mistake the popularity of an author or publication with the relevance of the scientific work developed, but it is an interesting comparative parameter. The co-citation analysis corresponds to works that are frequently cited together by other publications.\n\nThe greater the number of co-citations of a document, the greater its prominence in the literature, and the more likely its semantic relationship with the other two documents will be. Coupling establishes that when two documents cite the same third publication in their bibliographies, this is an indicator that these works have similarities [19, 23].\n\nIn TEMAC, it is common to delimit longer periods for co-citation than for coupling, since the first type of analysis is adopted to highlight the most-used thematic approaches in the study of a given topic (comprehensive panorama), while the second type, focuses on reduced intervals and, therefore, tends to show the main fronts of contemporary research [19, 23,24]. Therefore, in the present work, co-citation covered the period from 1991 to 2021, and coupling comprised the years from 2018 to 2021. Bearing in mind these methodological guidelines, interrelationships were established between the data obtained with the help of TEMAC and the content of the identified works.\n\n3. Results\n\nPreliminarily, 633 documents were obtained. It is considered essential to point out that, as biomimicry is a recent area\u2014especially when associated with the field of design\u2014various types of documents were examined in the present literature review, including articles, publications in proceedings of events, and books. The research of such works is pertinent because they represent important sources of information and can contain and record discoveries in emerging areas.\n\nThe oldest work found on the Web of Science was the article by Li et al. (1995), in which the authors explored structural applications of synthetic composites and natural bamboo fibers [25]. The material produced showed mechanical behavior similar to resistant structures present in nature. Considering this pioneering study with a biomimetic approach, it is pertinent to highlight that the initial works on the subject were directed mainly at the study of materials from an engineering perspective (especially at microscopic and nanoscopic scales), including physicochemical and structural investigations. With regard to pioneering efforts and research, it should be noted that studies and applications, more clearly related to the areas of design and architecture, followed in greater numbers after the publication of the book by Janine Benyus (1997), that is, from the end of the 1990s [22].\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n4 of 16\n\nBased on the examination of previous evidence, a filter according to knowledge areas was implemented in the subsequent step of the review. Thus, divergent categories were excluded (e.g., agriculture, medicine, dentistry, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, materials science, electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, nanoscience, nanotechnology, pharmacy, and neurosciences). This reduced the number of selected works to n = 196. Table 1 presents the analysis categories used to process the information and the respective quantitative data obtained from the search on the Web of Science. In this set of documents, it was noted that the areas of knowledge with the highest number of contributions, in descending order, were: engineering (n = 64), the science of technology (n = 41), environmental sciences, and ecology (n = 31), and architecture (n = 24). It is vital to mention that the Web of Science does not have a specific category for filtering documents published exclusively in the domain of design, unlike other areas of knowledge.\n\nThis limitation impacts the investigation and means that works of interest in this field are obtained only in related areas.\n\nTable 1.
