{"result": " The biological strategy discussed is based on the ability of spiders to travel through the air using electrostatic repulsion instead of wind currents. This is achieved by the spider releasing silk strands that pick up negative charges and are pushed away from negatively charged surfaces due to like charges repelling each other.\n\nKey Functions:\n1. Move in/Through Gases\n2. Modify Electric Charge\n3. Sense Electricity/Magnetism\n\nApplications of this strategy could include:\n1. Large scale: Analysis of underwater currents or detection of sea life.\n2. Micro scale: Sound detection in various products.\n3. Improving the ability of aircraft and ground vehicles to avoid collisions by adapting the strategy for greater sensitivity to environmental clues.\n4. Building the sensory capacity into wearable devices or clothing to detect motion beyond the range of vision.\n\nReferences:\n1. Barth, F.G. (2002). A Spider's World.
