{"result": " TRUE\nComposition of Extracellular Polymeric Substances from Periphyton Assemblages in the Florida Everglades 2, \"Water conservation area (WCA) 3 is a hard-water impoundment; periphyton was tightly associated with submerged aquatic vegetation and had a distinct filamentous algal assemblage dominated by Characeae. Extracellular polymers were primarily cell-associated capsules, sheaths, and slime layers. The EPS were homopolysaccharides composed mainly of glucose residues with minor amounts of xylose, arabinose, and mannose. Water conservation area (WCA) 4 is a transition zone between soft-water and hard-water impoundments; periphyton was loosely associated with submerged aquatic vegetation and had an assemblage intermediate in composition between WCA 1 and WCA 3. Extracellular polymers were abundant and varied in structure, including cell-associated capsules, sheaths, and slime layers. The EPS were heteropolysaccharides with significant amounts of glucose, xylose, arabinose, and mannose residues. These results suggest that the composition of EPS from periphyton assemblages in the Florida Everglades is influenced by local water quality, with differences in EPS chemistry affecting the functional roles of these polymers.\"", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

At ambient temperatures of 15, 20, and 25 degrees C, the average pinna temperatures were 23.0, 28.7, and 36.2 degrees C, respectively. From these temperatures, average heat loss from the total pinna surface area was calculated to be 2.8, 3.3, and 4.4 W, respectively. Preoptic temperature changes also affect the vasomotor state of the rabbit. At an ambient temperature of 20 degrees C, cooling the preoptic area of the rabbit by approximately 1 degree C resulted in an average pinna temperature of 26.5 degrees C and a heat loss of 2.4 W. Heating the preoptic area by approximately 1 degree C resulted in an average pinna temperature of 33.5 degrees C and a heat loss of 5.4 W. Finally, pinna temperatures were measured by use of a thermocouple and infrared thermography simultaneously. When the pinnae were vasodilated, the thermocouple measurements were consistently higher than the pinna surface temperatures measured thermographically. When the pinnae were vasoconstricted, the thermocouple measurements were consistently lower than the pinna surface temperatures measured thermographically. The discrepancy between the two methods of measurement is discussed.\",TRUE\nComparison of the structure and mechanical properties of bovine femur bone and antler of the North American elk (Cervus elaphus canadensis).,\"Antler and limb bone have a similar microstructure and chemical composition. Both are primarily composed of type I collagen and a mineral phase (carbonated apatite), arranged in osteons in compact (cortical bone) sections and a lamellar structure in the cancellous (spongy or trabecular bone) sections. The mineral content is lower in antler bone and it has a core of cancellous bone surrounded by compact bone running through the main beam and tines. The mineral content is higher in the compact compared with the cancellous bone, although there is no difference in ratios of the mineral elements with calcium. Mechanical tests (bend and compression) on longitudinal and transverse orientations of dry and rehydrated compact bone of North American elk (Cervus elaphus canadensis) antlers are compared with known data on other antlers as well as bovine femora. Both dry and rehydrated bones are highly anisotropic, with the bending and compressive strength and elastic modulus higher in the longitudinal than in the transverse direction. There is no significant difference between the bend strength and elastic modulus between dry and rehydrated samples tested in the transverse direction. The elastic modulus measured from the bending tests is compared with composite models. The elastic modulus and bend strengths are lower in the rehydrated condition, but the strain to failure and fracture toughness is much higher compared with dry samples. All antler bone mechanical properties are lower than that of bovine femora. The antler has a much higher fracture toughness compared with bovine femora, which correlates with their main function in intraspecific combat as a high impact resistant, energy absorbent material. A model of compression deformation is proposed, which is based on osteon sliding during shear.\",TRUE\nCOMPOSITION OF EXTRACELLULAR POLYMERIC SUBSTANCES FROM PERIPHYTON ASSEMBLAGES IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES 1,\"In wetland habitats, periphyton is a common component of open\u201a\u00c4\u00eawater areas with species assemblage determined by local water quality. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secreted by algae and bacteria give structure to periphyton, and differences in EPS chemistry affect the functional roles of these polymers. The Florida Everglades provide a unique opportunity to study compositional differences of EPS from distinctive algal assemblages that characterize areas of differing water chemistry. Water conservation area (WCA)\u201a\u00c4\u00ea1 is a soft\u201a\u00c4\u00eawater impoundment; periphyton was loosely associated with Utricularia stems and amorphous in structure, with a diverse desmid and diatom assemblage, and varying cyanobacterial abundance. Extracellular polymers were abundant and were loosely cell\u201a\u00c4\u00eaassociated sheaths and slime layers in addition to tightly cell\u201a\u00c4\u00eaassociated capsules.
