# Thread Name-Calling Injection

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/k4ff2bndq4juwnpc?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/hasherezade/thread-namecalling)

Remote shellcode injection technique, using Thread Name (a.k.a. Thread Description)

The code to be injected is passed as a thread description to the target (with `SetThreadDescription`). Then, a function `GetThreadDescription` is called remotely on the target, via APC, causing the description buffer to be copied into the targetâ€™s working set. After making the buffer executable, it is run using another APC call.

## Remote write via Thread Name

The buffer is injected into the remote process without the need of having the write privilege (`PROCESS_VM_WRITE`).

## Modules

+ `thread_namecaller` - implementation of Thread Name-Calling injection. Injects a shellcode that pops a calc into a process selected by the PID
+ `dll_inj` - a DLL injection variant. The path to the DLL is written into the remote process via Thread Name
+ `thread_receive` - a demo target application, with a [set of various mitigation policies](https://github.com/hasherezade/thread_namecalling/blob/master/thread_receive/main.cpp#L11)
