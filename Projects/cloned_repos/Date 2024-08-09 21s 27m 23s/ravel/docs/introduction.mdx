## About

Ravel emerges as the building block for [Valyent](https://valyent.dev) cloud services.

Ravel is a **bidding-style orchestrator** for _microVMs_. It allows you to create, manage, and destroy microVMs on the fly. It supports running OCI images inside cloud-hypervisor micro-vms.



## Technologies

- [Go](https://golang.org/): A fast, efficient programming language designed for building scalable software.
- [Cloud Hypervisor](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor): A lightweight virtual machine monitor for running modern cloud workloads.
- [NATS](https://nats.io/): A simple, high-performance messaging system for cloud applications and microservices.
- [Corrosion](https://github.com/superfly/corrosion): Gossip-based service discovery (and more) for large distributed systems.

## Features

- [x] Create, manage and destroy microVMs
