## WIP Roadmap

There is still a lot of work to be done to stabilize Ravel and make it ready for production:

- [ ] Create a process jailer for cloud-hypervisor (see the firecracker Jailer)
- [ ] Enforce resources limitations with cgroups
- [ ] Secure agent / manager communications with mTLS
- [ ] Improve the OCI images management on the agent
- [ ] Private networks with Wireguard
- [ ] Build a solid implementation of the server to ensure consistency and authorization
- [ ] Support public IPV6 address for machines
- [ ] Build a service discovery system and a proxy around Corrosion
- [ ] Implement machine migrations between workers
- [ ] Persistent volumes
- [ ] Lot of tests
- [ ] Handle different regions properly

## About

Ravel emerges as the building block for [Valyent](https://valyent.dev)'s cloud services.

Ravel is a **bidding-style orchestrator** for _microVMs_. It allows you to create, manage, and destroy microVMs on the fly. It supports running OCI images inside cloud-hypervisor micro-vms.

## Technologies

- [Go](https://golang.org/): A fast, efficient programming language designed for building scalable software.
- [Cloud Hypervisor](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor): A lightweight virtual machine monitor for running modern cloud workloads.
- [NATS](https://nats.io/): A simple, high-performance messaging system for cloud applications and microservices.
- [Corrosion](https://github.com/superfly/corrosion): Gossip-based service discovery (and more) for large distributed systems.

## Features

- [x] Create, manage and destroy microVMs
- [x] RESTful API
- [x] Bidding-style orchestrator
- [ ] Private networks
- [ ] Secrets management
- [ ] Multi-region
- [ ] Multi-tenancy

## Prerequisites

- [Go 1.22](https://golang.org/dl/)
