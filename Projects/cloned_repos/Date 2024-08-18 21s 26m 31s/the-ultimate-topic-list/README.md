Deployed at: [https://the-ultimate-topic-list.vercel.app](https://the-ultimate-topic-list.vercel.app)

This is the static and open-source version of [The Ultimate Topic List](https://youkn0wwho.academy/topic-list)

This has been created only to make sure that the list is available to everyone even if I die and the original website goes down. It can happen because on that website all data are hosted on Firebase and I won't be able to pay for Firebase services when I die.

I couldn't make the original website open-source because it mostly contains my private academy website's code.

## Which Website Should I Use?

You should definitely use the [original website](https://youkn0wwho.academy/topic-list) if it's still up and running because it will contain the latest data and it has way more features than this static version. This static version is only for backup purposes.

## How to Run

1. Fork and Clone the repository
2. Run `nvm use`
3. Run `yarn`
4. Run `yarn dev`
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this list, you can do so by creating a pull request. I will review it and merge it if it's good. Feel free to add new features, fix bugs, or improve the existing code.

Use prettier to format your code before creating a pull request.
