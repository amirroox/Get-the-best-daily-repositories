# TrollFools

In-place tweak injection with insert_dylib and ChOma.  
Proudly written in SwiftUI.  

Expected to work on all iOS versions supported by opa334â€™s TrollStore.

## Build

PRs are always welcome.  
You have to get precompiled binaries from released packages or build them yourself.

## Milestones

- [ ] `optool` is buggy so we need to compile a statically linked `install_name_tool` or `llvm-install-name-tool` on iOS to achieve a smaller package size.
- [ ] Support for `.deb` and `.zip`
