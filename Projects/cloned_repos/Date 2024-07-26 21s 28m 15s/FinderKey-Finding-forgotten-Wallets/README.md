How It Works: What Is a Mnemonic Phrase or Seed Phrase?

A mnemonic phrase or seed phrase is a set of 12 (sometimes 18 or 24) random English words that store all the information needed to recover a Bitcoin wallet on any device. All mnemonic phrases look something like this:

"inspire extra meat record november void game boy alley mimic other ten"

The seed words generated by your wallet are not random words. These words are taken from a specific set of 2048 words known as the Bip39 word list.
