## About Vortex Market
A Vortex is loosely defined as a whirling mass that sucks everything near it towards it. The question is, will it suck in buyers and vendors? Well, so far it does appear to be doing just that. Having entered the darknet scene in late 2023 it's been able to grow in popularity quickly thanks to the high profile closures of Kingdom Market, Nemesis Market, Incognito Market and Cypher Market, as well as a few smaller markets such as Sonanza. Let's see whether this market has what it takes to suck you in too.

No personal details or email address required, so anonymity fully respected as you would expect from any darknet market.
